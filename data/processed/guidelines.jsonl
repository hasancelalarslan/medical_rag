In 2013, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Advisory Council recommended that the NHLBI focus specifically on reviewing the highest-quality evidence and partner with other organizations to develop recommendations (1, 2). Accordingly, the ACC and AHA collaborated with the NHLBI and stakeholder and professional organizations to complete and publish 4 guidelines (on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle modifications to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of blood cholesterol in adults, and management of overweight and obesity in adults) to make them available to the widest possible constituency. In 2014, the ACC and AHA, in partnership with several other professional societies, initiated a guideline on the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure (BP) in adults. Under the management of the ACC/AHA Task Force, a Prevention Subcommittee was appointed to help guide development of the suite of guidelines on prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). These guidelines, which are based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a cornerstone for quality cardiovascular care. The ACC and AHA sponsor the development and publication of guidelines without commercial support, and members of each organization volunteer their time to the writing and review efforts. Guidelines are official policy of the ACC and AHA. Intended Use Practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing CVD. The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but guidelines developed in collaboration with other organizations can have a global impact. Althou gh guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, they are intended to improve patients’ quality of care and align with patients’ interests. Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances and should not replace clinical judgment. Clinical Implementation Management in accordance with guideline recommendations is effective only when followed by both practitioners and patients. Adherence to recommendations can be enhanced by share d decision making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities. Methodology and Modernization The ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines (Task Force) continuously reviews, updates, and modifies guideline methodology on the basis of published standards from organizations, including the Institute of Medicine (3, 4), and on the basis of internal reevaluation. Similarly, the presentation and delivery of guidelines are reevaluated and modified on the basis of evolving technologies and other factors to facilitate optimal dissemination of information to healthcare professionals at the point of care. Toward this goal , this guideline continues the introduction of an evolved format of presenting guideline recommendations and associated text called the “modular knowledge chunk format.” Each modular “chunk” includes a table of related recommendations, a brief synopsis, recommendation-specific supportive text, and when appropriate, flow diagrams or additional tables. References are provided within the modular chunk itself to facilitate quick review. Additionally, this format will facilitate seamless updating of guidelines with focused updates as new evidence is published, as well as content tagging for rapid electronic retrieval of related recommendations on a topic of interest. This evolved approach format was instituted when this guideline was near completion; therefore, the present document represents a transitional format that best suits the text as written. Future guidelines will fully implement this format, including provisions for limiting the amount of text in a guideline. by guest on November 13, 2017http://hyper.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from Whelton PK, et al. 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary Page 6 Recognizing the importance of cost–value considerations in certain guidelines, when appropriate and feasible, an analysis of the value of a drug, device, or intervention may be performed in accordance with the ACC/AHA methodology (5). To ensure that guideline recommendations remain current, new data are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with full guideline revisions commissioned in approximately 6 -year c ycles. Publication of new, potentially practice-changing study results that are relevant to an existing or new drug, device, or management strategy will prompt evaluation by the Task Force, in consultation with the relevant guideline writing committee, to determine whether a focused update should be commissioned. For additional information and policies regarding guideline development, we encourage readers to consult the ACC/AHA guideline methodology manual (6) and other methodology articles (7-10). Selection of Writing Committee Members The Task Force strives to avoid bias by selecting experts from a broad array of backgrounds. Writing committee members represent different geographic regions, sexes, ethnicities, races, intellectual perspectives/biases, and scopes of clinical practice. The Task Force may also invite organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise to participate as partners, collaborators, or endorsers. Relationships With Industry and Other Entities The ACC and AHA have rigorous policies and methods to ensure that guidelines are developed without bias or improper influence. The complete relationships with industry and other entities (RWI) policy can be found at http://www.acc.org/guidelines/about-guidelines-and-clinical-documents/relationships-with-industry-policy. Appendix 1 of the present document lists writing committee members’ relevant RWI. For the purposes of full transparency, writing committee members’ comprehensive disclosure information is available online (http://hyper.ahajournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1161/HYP.0000000000000066/-/DC1). Comprehensive disclosure information for the Task Force is available at http://www.acc.org/guidelines/about-guidelines-and- clinical-documents/guidelines-and-documents-task-forces. Evidence Review and Evidence Review Committees In developing recommendations, the writing committee uses evidence-based methodologies that are based on all available data (6-9). Literature searches focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include registries, nonrandomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. Only key references are cited. An independent evidence review committee (ERC) is commissioned when there are 1 or more questions deemed of utmost clinical importance that merit formal systematic review. The systematic review will determine which patients are most likely to benefit from a drug, device, or treatment strategy and to what degree. Criteria for commissioning an ERC and formal systematic review include: a) the absence of a current authoritative systematic review, b) the feasibility of defining the benefit and risk in a time frame consistent with the writing of a guideline, c) the relevance to a substantial number of patients, and d) the likelihood that the findings can be translated into actionable recommendations. ERC members may include methodologists, epidemiologists, healthcare providers, and biostatisticians. The recommendations developed by the writing committee on the basis of the systematic review are marked with “SR”. Guideline-Directed Management and Therapy The term guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT) encompasses clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, and pharmacological and procedural treatments. For these and all recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader should confirm the dosage by reviewing product insert material and evaluate the treatment regimen for contraindications and interactions. The recommendations are limited to drugs, devices, and treatments approved for clinical use in the United States. by guest on November 13, 2017http://hyper.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from Whelton PK, et al. 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary Page 7 Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence The Class of Recommendation (COR) indicates the strength of the recommendation, encompassing the estimated magnitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to risk. The Level of Evidence (LOE) rates the quality of scientific evidence that supports the intervention on the basis of the type, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other sources (Table 1) (6-8).

Introduction In 2013, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Advisory Council recommended that the NHLBI focus specifically on reviewing the highest-quality evidence and partner with other organizations to develop recommendations (1, 2) . Accordingly, the ACC and AHA collaborated with the NHLBI and stakeholder and professional organizations to complete and publish 4 guidelines (on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle modifications to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of blood cholesterol in adults, and management of overweight and obesity in adults) to make them available to the widest possible constituency. In 2014, the ACC and AHA in partnership with several other professional societies initiated a guideline on the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults. Under the management of the ACC/AHA Task Force, a Prevention Subcommittee was appointed to help guide development of the suite of guidelines on prevention of cardiovascular disease. As early as the 1920s, and subsequently in the 1959 Build and Blood Pressure Study (3) of almost 5 million adults insured between 1934 and 1954, a strong direct relationship was noted between level of BP and risk of clinical complications and death. In the 1960s, these findings were confirmed in a series of reports from the Framingham Heart Study (4). The 1967 and 1970 Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group reports ushered in the era of effective treatment for high BP (5, 6). The f irst comprehensive guideline for detection, evaluation, and management of high BP was published in 1977, under the sponsorship of the NHLBI (7). In subsequent years, a series of Joint National Committee (JNC) BP guidelines were published to assist the practice community and improve prevention, awareness, treatment, and control of high BP (7-9). The present guideline updates prior JNC reports. 1.1. Methodology and Evidence Review An extensive evidence review, which included literature derived from research involving human subjects, published in English, and indexed in MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline, was conducted between February and August 2015. Key search words included but were not limited to the following: adherence; aerobic; alcohol intake; ambulatory care; antihypertensive: agents, drug, medication, therapy; beta adrenergic blockers; blood pressure: arterial, control, determination, devices, goal, high, improve, measurement, monitoring, ambulatory; calcium channel blockers; diet; diuretic agent; drug therapy; heart failure: diastolic, systolic; hypertension: white coat, masked, ambulatory, isolated ambulatory, isolated clinic, diagnosis, reverse white coat, prevention, therapy, treatment, control; intervention; lifestyle: measures, modification; office visits; patient outcome; performance measures; physical activity; potassium intake; protein intake; renin inhibitor; risk reduction: behavior, counseling; screening; sphygmomanometers; spironolactone; therapy; treatment: adherence, compliance, efficacy, outcome, protocol, regimen; weight. Additional relevant studies published through June 2016, during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables when appropriate. The final evidence tables included in the Online Data Supplement (http://hyper.ahajournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1161/HYP.0000000000000066/-/DC2) summarize the evidence used by the writing committee to formulate recommendations. As noted in the preamble, an independent ERC was commissioned to perform a formal systematic review of 4 critical clinical questions related to hypertension (Table 2), the results of which were considered by the writing committee for incorporation into thi s guideline. Concurrent with this process, writing committee members evaluated other published data relevant to the guideline. The findings of the ERC and the writing committee members were formally presented and discussed, and then guideline recommendations were developed. The systematic review report, “Systematic Review for the 2017 ACC/AHA/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/AGS/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, by guest on November 13, 2017http://hyper.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from Whelton PK, et al. 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary Page 11 Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults,” is published in conjunction with this guideline (10), and its respective data supplements are available online (http://hyper.ahajournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1161/HYP.0000000000000067/-/DC2). No writing committee member reported a RWI. Drs. Whelton, Wright and Williamson had leadership roles in SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial). Dr. Carey chaired committee discussions in which the SPRINT results were considered. Table 2. Systematic Review Questions on High BP in Adults Question Number Question Section Number 1 Is there evidence that self-directed monitoring of BP and/or ambulatory BP monitoring are superior to office-based measurement of BP by a healthcare worker for 1) preventing adverse outcomes for which high BP is a risk factor and 2) achieving better BP control? 4.2 2 What is the optimal target for BP lowering during antihypertensive therapy in adults? 8.1.5 9.3 9.6 3 In adults with hypertension, do various antihypertensive drug classes differ in their comparative benefits and harms? 8.1.6 8.2 4 In adults with hypertension, does initiating treatment with antihypertensive pharmacological monotherapy versus initiating treatment with 2 drugs (including fixed- dose combination therapy), either of which may be followed by the addition of sequential drugs, differ in comparative benefits and/or harms on specific health outcomes? 8.1.6.1 BP indicates blood pressure. 1.2. Organization of the Writing Committee The writing committee consisted of clinicians, cardiologists, epidemiologists, internists, an endocrinologist, a geriatrician, a nephrologist, a neurologist, a nurse, a pharmacist, a physician assistant, and 2 lay/patient representatives. It included representatives from the ACC, AHA, American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA), Association of Black Cardiologists (ABC), American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM), American Geriatrics Society (AGS), American Pharmacists Association (APhA), American Society of Hypertension (ASH), American Society for Preventive Cardiology (ASPC), National Medical Association (NMA), and Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association (PCNA). 1.3. Document Review and Approval This document was reviewed by 2 official reviewers nominated by the ACC and AHA; 1 reviewer each from the AAPA, ABC, ACPM, AGS, APhA, ASH, ASPC NMA, and PCNA; and 38 individual content reviewers. Reviewers’ RWI information was distributed to the writing committee and is published in this document (Appendix 2). This document was approved for publication by the governing bodies of the ACC, AHA, AAPA, ABC, ACPM, AGS, APhA, ASH, ASPC, NMA, and PCNA. 1.4. Scope of the Guideline The present guideline is intended to be a resource for the clinical and public health practice communities. It is designed to be comprehensive but succinct and practical in providing guidance for prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high BP. It is an update of the NHLBI publication, “The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure” (JNC by guest on November 13, 2017http://hyper.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from Whelton PK, et al. 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary Page 12 7) (9). It incorporates new information from studies of office-based BP-related risk of CVD, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM), telemedicine, and various other areas. This guideline does not address the use of BP-lowering medications for the purposes of prevention of recurrent CVD events in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) or chronic heart failure (HF) in the absence of hypertension; these topics are the focus of other ACC/AHA guidelines (11, 12). In developing the present guideline, the writing committee reviewed prior published guidelines, evidence reviews, and related statements.

Observational Relationship Observational studies have demonstrated graded associations between higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and increased CVD risk (1, 2). In a meta-analysis of 61 prospective studies, the risk of CVD increased in a log-linear fashion from SBP levels <115 mm Hg to >180 mm Hg and from DBP levels <75 mm Hg to >105 mm Hg (1). In that analysis, 20 mm Hg higher SBP and 10 mm Hg higher DBP were each associated with a doubling in the risk of death from stroke, heart disease, or other vascular disease. In a separate observational study including >1 million adult patients ≥30 years of age, higher SBP and DBP were associated with increased risk of CVD incidence and angina, myocardial infarction (MI), HF, stroke, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and abdominal aortic aneurysm, each evaluated separately (2). An increased risk of CVD associated with higher SBP and DBP has been reported across a broad age spectrum, from 30 years to >80 by guest on November 13, 2017http://hyper.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from Whelton PK, et al. 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary Page 17 years of age. Although the relative risk of incident CVD associated with higher SBP and DBP is smaller at older ages, the corresponding high BP–related increase in absolute risk is larger in older persons (≥65 years) given the higher absolute risk of CVD at an older age (1).

BP Components Epidemiological studies have evaluated associations of SBP and DBP, as well as derived components of BP measurements (including pulse pressure, mean BP, and mid -BP), with CVD outcomes (Table 4). When considered separately, higher levels of both SBP and DBP have been associated with increased CVD risk (1, 2). Higher SBP has consistently been associated with increased CVD risk after adjustment for, or within strata of, DBP (3-5). In contrast, after consideration of SBP through adjustment or stratification, DBP has not been consistently associated with CVD risk (6, 7). Although pulse pressure and mid-BP have been associated with increased CVD risk independent of SBP and DBP in some studies, SBP (especially) and DBP are prioritized in the present document because of the robust evidence base for these measures in both observational studies and clinical trials and because of their ease of measurement in practice settings (8-11).

Am J Cardiol. 2014;113:1058-65. 2.3. Population Risk In 2010, high BP was the leading cause of death and disability -adjusted life years worldwide (1, 2). In the United States, hypertension (see Section 3.1 for definition) accounted for more CVD deaths than any other modifiable CVD risk factor and was second only to cigarette smoking as a preventable cause of death for any reason (3). In a follow-up study of 23,272 U.S. NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) participants, >50% of deaths from coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke occurred among individuals with hypertension (4). Because of the high prevalence of hypertension and its associated increased risk of CHD, stroke, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the population-attributable risk of these outcomes associated with hypertension is high (4, 5). In the population-based ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study, 25% of the cardiovascular events (CHD, coronary revascularization, stroke, or HF) were attributable to hypertension. In the Northern Manhattan study, the percentage of events attributable to hypertension was higher in women (32%) than in men (19%) and higher in blacks (36%) than in whites (21%) (6). In 2012, hypertension was the second leading assigned cause of ESRD, behind diabetes mellitus (DM), and accounted for 34% of incident ESRD cases in the U.S. population (7). References 1.

Lifetime Risk of Hypertension Observational studies have documented a relatively high incidence of hypertension over periods of 5 to 10 years of follow-up (1, 2). Thus, there is a much higher long -term population burden of hypertension as BP progressively increases with age. Several studies have estimated the long -term cumulative incidence of developing hypertension (3, 4). In an analysis of 1132 white male medical students (mean age: approximately 23 years at baseline) in the Johns Hopkins Precursors study, 0.3%, 6.5%, and 37% developed hypertension at age 25, 45, and 65 years, respectively (5). In MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), the percentage of the population developing hypertension over their lifetimes was higher for African Americans and Hispanics than for whites and Asians (3). For adults 45 years of age without hypertension, the 40-year risk of developing hypertension was 93% for African-American, 92% for Hispanic, 86% for white, and 84% for Chinese adults (3). In the Framingham Heart Study, approximately 90% of adults free of hypertension at age 55 or 65 years developed hypertension during their lifetimes (4). All of these estimates were based on use of the 140/90– mm Hg cutpoint for recognition of hypertension and would have been higher had the 130/80–mm Hg cutpoint been used. References 1.

Accurate Measurement of BP in the Office Recommendation for Accurate Measurement of BP in the Office COR LOE Recommendation I C-EO 1. For diagnosis and management of high BP, proper methods are recommended for accurate measurement and documentation of BP (Table 8). by guest on November 13, 2017http://hyper.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from Whelton PK, et al. 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary Page 23 Table 8. Checklist for Accurate Measurement of BP (1, 2) Key Steps for Proper BP Measurements Specific Instructions Step 1: Properly prepare the patient 1. Have the patient relax, sitting in a chair (feet on floor, back supported) for >5 min. 2. The patient should avoid caffeine, exercise, and smoking for at least 30 min before measurement. 3. Ensure patient has emptied his/her bladder. 4. Neither the patient nor the observer should talk during the rest period or during the measurement. 5. Remove all clothing covering the location of cuff placement. 6. Measurements made while the patient is sitting or lying on an examining table do not fulfill these criteria. Step 2: Use proper technique for BP measurements 1. Use a BP measurement device that has been validated, and ensure that the device is calibrated periodically.* 2. Support the patient’s arm (e.g., resting on a desk). 3. Position the middle of the cuff on the patient’s upper arm at the level of the right atrium (the midpoint of the sternum). 4. Use the correct cuff size, such that the bladder encircles 80% of the arm, and note if a larger- or smaller-than-normal cuff size is used (Table 9). 5. Either the stethoscope diaphragm or bell may be used for auscultatory readings (3, 4). Step 3: Take the proper measurements needed for diagnosis and treatment of elevated BP/hypertension 1. At the first visit, record BP in both arms. Use the arm that gives the higher reading for subsequent readings. 2. Separate repeated measurements by 1–2 min. 3. For auscultatory determinations, use a palpated estimate of radial pulse obliteration pressure to estimate SBP. Inflate the cuff 20–30 mm Hg above this level for an auscultatory determination of the BP level. 4. For auscultatory readings, deflate the cuff pressure 2 mm Hg per second, and listen for Korotkoff sounds. Step 4: Properly document accurate BP readings 1. Record SBP and DBP. If using the auscultatory technique, record SBP and DBP as onset of the first Korotkoff sound and disappearance of all Korotkoff sounds, respectively, using the nearest even number. 2. Note the time of most recent BP medication taken before measurements. Step 5: Average the readings Use an average of ≥2 readings obtained on ≥2 occasions to estimate the individual’s level of BP. Step 6: Provide BP readings to patient Provide patients the SBP/DBP readings both verbally and in writing. *See Section 4.2 for additional guidance.

Out-of-Office and Self-Monitoring of BP Recommendation for Out-of-Office and Self-Monitoring of BP References that support the recommendation are summarized in Online Data Supplement 3 and Systematic Review Report. COR LOE Recommendation I ASR 1. Out-of-office BP measurements are recommended to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension (Table 11) and for titration of BP-lowering medication, in conjunction with telehealth counseling or clinical interventions (1-4). SR indicates systematic review. Table 10. Procedures for Use of HBPM (5-7) Patient training should occur under medical supervision, including: • Information about hypertension • Selection of equipment • Acknowledgment that individual BP readings may vary substantially • Interpretation of results Devices: • Verify use of automated validated devices. Use of auscultatory devices (mercury, aneroid, or other) is not generally useful for HBPM because patients rarely master the technique required for measurement of BP with auscultatory devices. • Monitors with provision for storage of readings in memory are preferred. • Verify use of appropriate cuff size to fit the arm (Table 9). • Verify that left/right inter-arm differences are insignificant. If differences are significant, instruct patient to measure BPs in the arm with higher readings. Instructions on HBPM procedures: • Remain still: • Avoid smoking, caffeinated beverages, or exercise within 30 min before BP measurements. • Ensure ≥5 min of quiet rest before BP measurements. • Sit correctly: by guest on November 13, 2017http://hyper.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from Whelton PK, et al. 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary Page 25 • Sit with back straight and supported (on a straight-backed dining chair, for example, rather than a sofa). • Sit with feet flat on the floor and legs uncrossed. • Keep arm supported on a flat surface (such as a table), with the upper arm at heart level. • Bottom of the cuff should be placed directly above the antecubital fossa (bend of the elbow). • Take multiple readings: • Take at least 2 readings 1 min apart in morning before taking medications and in evening before supper. Optimally, measure and record BP daily. Ideally, obtain weekly BP readings beginning 2 weeks after a change in the treatment regimen and during the week before a clinic visit. • Record all readings accurately: • Monitors with built-in memory should be brought to all clinic appointments. • BP should be based on an average of readings on ≥2 occasions for clinical decision making.

Masked and White Coat Hypertension Recommendations for Masked and White Coat Hypertension References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 4, 5, and 6. COR LOE Recommendation IIa B-NR 1. In adults with an untreated SBP greater than 130 mm Hg but less than 160 mm Hg or DBP greater than 80 mm Hg but less than 100 mm Hg, it is reasonable to screen for the presence of white coat hypertension by using either daytime ABPM or HBPM before diagnosis of hypertension (1-8). IIa C-LD 2. In adults with white coat hypertension, periodic monitoring with either ABPM or HBPM is reasonable to detect transition to sustained hypertension (2, 5, 7). IIa C- LD 3. In adults being treated for hypertension with office BP readings not at goal and HBPM readings suggestive of a significant white coat effect, confirmation by ABPM can be useful (9, 10). IIa B-NR 4. In adults with untreated office BPs that are consistently between 120 mm Hg and 129 mm Hg for SBP or between 75 mm Hg and 79 mm Hg for DBP, screening for masked hypertension with HBPM (or ABPM) is reasonable (3, 4, 6, 8, 11). IIb C-LD 5. In adults on multiple-drug therapies for hypertension and office BPs within 10 mm Hg above goal, it may be reasonable to screen for white coat effect with HBPM (or ABPM) (3, 7, 12). IIb C-EO 6. It may be reasonable to screen for masked uncontrolled hypertension with HBPM in adults being treated for hypertension and office readings at goal, in the presence of target organ damage or increased overall CVD risk. IIb C-EO 7. In adults being treated for hypertension with elevated HBPM readings suggestive of masked uncontrolled hypertension, confirmation of the diagnosis by ABPM might be reasonable before intensification of antihypertensive drug treatment.

Historical Features Favoring Hypertension Cause Primary Hypertension Secondary Hypertension • Gradual increase in BP, with slow rate of rise in BP • Lifestyle factors that favor higher BP (e.g., weight gain, high-sodium diet, decreased physical activity, job change entailing increased travel, excessive consumption of alcohol) • Family history of hypertension • BP lability, episodic pallor and dizziness (pheochromocytoma) • Snoring, hypersomnolence (obstructive sleep apnea) • Prostatism (chronic kidney disease due to post-renal urinary tract obstruction) • Muscle cramps, weakness (hypokalemia from primary aldosteronism or secondary aldosteronism due to renovascular disease) • Weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance (hyperthyroidism) • Edema, fatigue, frequent urination (kidney disease or failure) • History of coarctation repair (residual hypertension associated with coarctation) • Central obesity, facial rounding, easy bruisability (Cushing's syndrome) by guest on November 13, 2017http://hyper.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from Whelton PK, et al. 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary Page 42 • Medication or substance use (e.g., alcohol, NSAIDS, cocaine, amphetamines) • Absence of family history of hypertension BP indicates blood pressure; and NSAIDs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 7.1. Laboratory Tests and Other Diagnostic Procedures Table 17. Basic and Optional Laboratory Tests for Primary Hypertension Basic testing Fasting blood glucose* Complete blood count Lipid profile Serum creatinine with eGFR* Serum sodium, potassium, calcium* Thyroid-stimulating hormone Urinalysis Electrocardiogram Optional testing Echocardiogram Uric acid Urinary albumin to creatinine ratio *May be included in a comprehensive metabolic panel. eGFR indicates estimated glomerular filtration rate. 8. Treatment of High BP 8.1. Pharmacological Treatment 8.1.1. Initiation of Pharmacological BP Treatment in the Context of Overall CVD Risk For any specific difference in BP, the relative risk of CVD is constant across groups that differ in absolute risk of atherosclerotic CVD (1-4), albeit with some evidence of lesser relative risk but greater excess risk in older than in younger adults (5-8). Thus, there are more potentially preventable CVD events attributable to elevated BP in individuals with higher than with lower risk of CVD and in older than in younger adults. The relative risk reduction for CVD prevention with use of BP-lowering medications is fairly constant for groups that differ in CVD risk across a wide range of estimated absolute risk (9, 10) and across groups defined by sex, age, body mass index, and the presence or absence of DM, AF, and CKD (5, 11-21). As a consequence, the absolute CVD risk reduction attributable to BP lowering is greater at greater absolute levels of CVD risk (9, 10, 12, 15-19, 22, 23). Put another way, for a given magnitude of BP reduction due to antihypertensive medications, fewer individuals at high CVD risk would need to be treated to prevent a CVD event (i.e., lower number needed to treat) than those at low CVD risk.

Follow-Up of BP During Antihypertensive Drug Therapy Appropriate follow-up and monitoring enable assessment of adherence (see Section 12.1) and response to therapy, help identify adverse responses to therapy and target organ damage, and allow assessment of progress toward treatment goals. High-quality RCTs have successfully and safely developed strategies for follow-up, monitoring, and reassessment from which recommendations can be made (Figure 4) (1, 2). A systematic approach to out-of-office BP assessment is an essential part of follow-up and monitoring of BP, to assess response to therapy; check for evidence of white coat hypertension, white coat effect, masked hypertension, or masked uncontrolled hypertension; and help achieve BP targets (see Sections 4 and 12).

Hypertension in Patients With Comorbidities Certain comorbidities may affect clinical decision -making in hypertension. These include ischemic heart disease, HF with reduced ejection fraction (HF rEF), HF pEF, CKD (including renal transplantation), cerebrovascular disease, AF, PAD, DM, and metabolic syndrome (1). As noted in Section 8.1.2, this guideline generally recommends use of BP -lowering medications for secondary prevention of CVD in patients with clinical CVD (CHD, HF, and stroke) and an average BP ≥130/80 mm Hg and for primary prevention of CVD in adults with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥10% and an average SBP ≥130 mm Hg or an average DBP ≥80 mm Hg. Although we recommend use of the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations (http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD- Risk-Estimator/) to estimate 10 -year risk of ASCVD to establish the BP threshold for treatment, the vast majority of adults with a co-morbidity are likely to have a 10-year risk of ASCVD that exceeds 10%. In some by guest on November 13, 2017http://hyper.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from Whelton PK, et al. 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary Page 54 instances, clinical trial confirmation of treatment in patients with comorbidities is limited to a target BP of 140/90 mm Hg. In addition, the selection of medications for use in treating high BP in patients with CVD is guided by their use for other compelling indications (e.g., beta blockers after MI, ACE inhibitors for HFrEF), as discussed in specific guidelines for the clinical condition (2-4). The present guideline does not address the recommendations for treatment of hypertension occurring with acute coronary syndromes. References 1. Aronow WS, Fleg JL, Pepine CJ, et al.

Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is a state of metabolic dysregulation characterized by visceral fat accumulation, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia, as well as predisposition to type 2 DM, hypertension, and atherosclerotic CVD (1-3). According to data from the NHANES III and NHANES 1999 –2006 (1, 4) , the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the United States was 34.2% in 2006 and has likely increased substantially since that time. The metabolic syndrome is linked to several other disorders, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, polycystic ovary syndrome, certain cancers, CKD, Alzheimer’s disease, Cushing’s syndrome, lipodystrophy, and hyperalimentation (5, 6). Lifestyle modification, with an emphasis on improving insulin sensitivity by means of dietary modification, weight reduction, and exercise, is the foundation of treatment of the metabolic syndrome. The optimal antihypertensive drug therapy for patients with hypertension in the setting of the metabolic syndrome has not been clearly defined (1). Although caution exists with regard to the use of thiazide diuretics in this population because of their ability to increase insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hyperuricemia and to accelerate conversion to overt DM, no data are currently available demonstrating deterioration in cardiovascular or renal outcomes in patients treated with these agents (1). Indeed, as shown in follow-up of ALLHAT, chlorthalidone use was associated with only a small increase in fasting glucose levels (1.5–4.0 mg/dL), and this increase did not translate into increased CVD risk at a later date (7-10). In addition, in post hoc analysis of the nearly two thirds of participants in ALLHAT that met criteria for the metabolic syndrome, chlorthalidone was unsurpassed in reducing CVD and renal outcomes compared with lisinopril, amlodipine, or doxazosin (9, 11). Similarly, high -dose ARB therapy reduces arterial stiffness in patients with hypertension with the metabolic syndrome, but no outcomes data are available from patients in which this form of treatment was used (12). Use of traditional beta blockers may lead to dyslipidemia or deterioration of glucose tolerance, and ability to lose weight (2). In several large clinical trials, the risk of developing DM as a result of traditional beta- blocker therapy was 15% to 29% (2). However, the newer vasodilating beta blockers (e.g., labetalol, carvedilol, nebivolol) have shown neutral or favorable effects on metabolic profiles compared with the traditional beta by guest on November 13, 2017http://hyper.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from Whelton PK, et al. 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary Page 68 blockers (13). Trials using vasodilator beta blockers have not been performed to demonstrate effects on CVD outcomes. References 1. Lim S, Eckel RH.

Sex-Related Issues The prevalence of hypertension is lower in women than in men until about the fifth decade but is higher later in life (1). Other than special recommendations for management of hypertension during pregnancy, there is no evidence that the BP threshold for initiating drug treatment, the treatment target, the choice of initial antihypertensive medication, or the combination of medications for lowering BP differs for women versus men (2, 3).

Do men and women respond differently to blood pressure-lowering treatment? Results of prospectively designed overviews of randomized trials. Eur Heart J. 2008;29:2669-80. 10.2.1. Women A potential limitation of RCTs, including SPRINT, is that they are not specifically powered to determine the value of intensive SBP reduction in subgroups, including women in the case of SPRINT. However, in prespecified analyses, there was no evidence of a n interaction between sex and treatment effect. Furthermore, no significant differences in CVD outcomes were observed between men and women in a large meta-analysis that included 31 RCTs with about 100,000 men and 90,000 women with hypertension (1 Some have called for conduct of a SPRINT -like trial with sufficient power to assess the effects of intensive SBP reduction in women {Wenger, 2016 #9131). Some have called for a SPRINT-like trial with sufficient power to assess the effects of intensive SBP reduction in women (2). In meta-analyses, there was no convincing evidence that different antihypertensive drug classes exerted sex-related differences in BP lowering or provided distinct CVD protection (1). Calcium antagonists offered slightly greater benefits for stroke prevention than did ACE inhibitors for women than for men, whereas calcium antagonists reduced all-cause deaths compared with placebo in men but not in women. However, these sex-related differences might have been due to chance because of the large number of statistical comparisons that were perfor med. The Heart Attack Trial and Hypertension Care Computing Project reported that beta blockers were associated with reduced mortality in men but not in women, but this finding was likely due to the low event rates in women (3). Similarly, in the open-label Second Australian National BP study, a significant reduction in CVD events was demonstrated in men but not in women with ACE inhibitors versus diuretics (4). Adverse effects of antihypertensive therapy were noted twice as often in women as in men in the TOMHS study (5). A higher incidence of ACE inhibitor–induced cough and of edema with calcium antagonists was observed in women than in men (6). Women were more likely to experience hypokalemia and hyponatremia and less likely to experience gout with diuretics (7). Hypertension in pregnancy has special requirements (see Section 10.2.2).

Hypertensive Crises—Emergencies and Urgencies Recommendations for Hypertensive Crises and Emergencies References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 55. COR LOE Recommendations I B-NR 1. In adults with a hypertensive emergency, admission to an intensive care unit is recommended for continuous monitoring of BP and target organ damage and for parenteral administration of an appropriate agent (Tables 19 and 20) (1, 2). I C-EO 2. For adults with a compelling condition (i.e., aortic dissection, severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, or pheochromocytoma crisis), SBP should be reduced to less than 140 mm Hg during the first hour and to less than 120 mm Hg in aortic dissection. I C-EO 3. For adults without a compelling condition, SBP should be reduced by no more than 25% within the first hour; then, if stable, to 160/100 mm Hg within the next 2 to 6 hours; and then cautiously to normal during the following 24 to 48 hours. by guest on November 13, 2017http://hyper.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from Whelton PK, et al. 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary Page 75 Figure 11.

Intravenous Antihypertensive Drugs for Treatment of Hypertensive Emergencies Class Drug(s) Usual Dose Range Comments CCB— dihydropyridines Nicardipine Initial 5 mg/h, increasing every 5 min by 2.5 mg/h to maximum 15 mg/h. Contraindicated in advanced aortic stenosis; no dose adjustment needed for elderly. Clevidipine Initial 1–2 mg/h, doubling every 90 s until BP approaches target, then increasing by less than double every 5–10 min; maximum dose 32 mg/h; maximum duration 72 h. Contraindicated in patients with soybean, soy product, egg, and egg product allergy and in patients with defective lipid metabolism (e.g., pathological hyperlipidemia, lipoid nephrosis or acute pancreatitis). Use low-end dose range for elderly patients. Vasodilators— Nitric-oxide dependent Sodium nitroprusside Initial 0.3–0.5 mcg/kg/min; increase in increments of 0.5 mcg/kg/min to achieve BP target; maximum dose 10 mcg/kg/min; duration of treatment as short as possible. For infusion rates ≥4–10 mcg/kg/min or duration >30 min, thiosulfate can be coadministered to prevent cyanide toxicity. Intra-arterial BP monitoring recommended to prevent “overshoot.” Lower dosing adjustment required for elderly. Tachyphylaxis common with extended use. Cyanide toxicity with prolonged use can result in irreversible neurological changes and cardiac arrest. Nitroglycerin Initial 5 mcg/min; increase in increments of 5 mcg/min every 3–5 min to a maximum of 20 mcg/min. Use only in patients with acute coronary syndrome and/or acute pulmonary edema. Do not use in volume-depleted patients. Vasodilators— direct Hydralazine Initial 10 mg via slow IV infusion (maximum initial dose 20 mg); repeat every 4–6 h as needed. BP begins to decrease within 10–30 min, and the fall lasts 2–4 h. Unpredictability of response and prolonged duration of action do not make hydralazine a desirable first-line agent for acute treatment in most patients. Adrenergic blockers—beta1 receptor selective antagonist Esmolol Loading dose 500–1000 mcg/kg/min over 1 min followed by a 50- mcg/kg/min infusion. For additional dosing, the bolus dose is repeated and the infusion increased in 50- mcg/kg/min increments as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg/kg/min. Contraindicated in patients with concurrent beta-blocker therapy, bradycardia, or decompensated HF. Monitor for bradycardia. May worsen HF. Higher doses may block beta2 receptors and impact lung function in reactive airway disease. Adrenergic blockers— combined alpha1 and nonselective Labetalol Initial 0.3–1.0-mg/kg dose (maximum 20 mg) slow IV injection every 10 min or 0.4–1.0-mg/kg/h IV infusion up to 3 mg/kg/h. Adjust Contraindicated in reactive airways disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Especially useful in hyperadrenergic syndromes. May worsen HF and should not be given in by guest on November 13, 2017http://hyper.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from Whelton PK, et al. 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary Page 77 beta receptor antagonist rate up to total cumulative dose of 300 mg. This dose can be repeated every 4–6 h. patients with second- or third-degree heart block or bradycardia. Adrenergic blockers— nonselective alpha receptor antagonist Phentolamine IV bolus dose 5 mg. Additional bolus doses every 10 min as needed to lower BP to target. Used in hypertensive emergencies induced by catecholamine excess (pheochromocytoma, interactions between monamine oxidase inhibitors and other drugs or food, cocaine toxicity, amphetamine overdose, or clonidine withdrawal). Dopamine1- receptor selective agonist Fenoldopam Initial 0.1–0.3 mcg/kg/min; may be increased in increments of 0.05–0.1 mcg/kg/min every 15 min until target BP is reached. Maximum infusion rate 1.6 mcg/kg/min. Contraindicated in patients at risk of increased intraocular pressure (glaucoma) or intracranial pressure and those with sulfite allergy. ACE inhibitor Enalaprilat Initial 1.25 mg over a 5-min period. Doses can be increased up to 5 mg every 6 h as needed to achieve BP target. Contraindicated in pregnancy and should not be used in acute MI or bilateral renal artery stenosis. Mainly useful in hypertensive emergencies associated with high plasma renin activity. Dose not easily adjusted. Relatively slow onset of action (15 min) and unpredictability of BP response. BP indicates blood pressure; CCB, calcium channel blocker; HF, heart failure; IV, intravenous; and MI, myocardial infarction. by guest on November 13, 2017http://hyper.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from Whelton PK, et al. 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary Page 78 Table 20. Intravenous Antihypertensive Drugs for Treatment of Hypertensive Emergencies in Patients With Selected Comorbidities Comorbidity Preferred Drug(s)* Comments Acute aortic dissection Esmolol labetalol Requires rapid lowering of SBP to ≤120 mm Hg. Beta blockade should precede vasodilator (e.g., nicardipine or nitroprusside) administration, if needed for BP control or to prevent reflex tachycardia or inotropic effect; SBP ≤120 mm Hg should be achieved within 20 min. Acute pulmonary edema Clevidipine, nitroglycerin nitroprusside Βeta blockers contraindicated. Acute coronary syndromes Esmolol† labetalol nicardipine nitroglycerin† Nitrates given in the presence of PDE-5 inhibitors may induce profound hypotension. Contraindications to beta blockers include moderate-to-severe LV failure with pulmonary edema, bradycardia (<60 bpm), hypotension (SBP <100 mm Hg), poor peripheral perfusion, second- or third-degree heart block, and reactive airways disease. Acute renal failure Clevidipine fenoldopam nicardipine N/A Eclampsia or preeclampsia Hydralazine labetalol nicardipine Requires rapid BP lowering. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, renin inhibitors, and nitroprusside contraindicated. Perioperative hypertension (BP ≥160/90 mm Hg or SBP elevation ≥20% of the preoperative value that persists for >15 min) Clevidipine esmolol nicardipine, nitroglycerin Intraoperative hypertension is most frequently seen during anesthesia induction and airway manipulation. Acute sympathetic discharge or catecholamine excess states (e.g., pheochromocytoma, post- carotid endarterectomy status) Clevidipine nicardipine phentolamine Requires rapid lowering of BP. Acute ICH Section 9.4.1 Section 9.4.1 Acute ischemic stroke Section 9.4.2 Section 9.4.2 *Agents are listed in alphabetical order, not in order of preference. †Agent of choice for acute coronary syndromes. ACE indicates angiotensin-converting enzyme; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; BP, blood pressure; bpm, beats per minute; ICH, intracerebral hemorrhage; LV, left ventricular; PDE-5, phosphodiesterase type-5; and SBP, systolic blood pressure.

Health Literacy Communicating alternative behaviors that support self-management of healthy BP in addition to medication adherence is important. This should be done both verbally and in writing. Today, mobile phones have a recording option. For patients with mobile phones, the phone can be used to inform patients and family members of medical instructions after the doctor’s visit as an additional level of communication. Inclusion of a family member or friend that can help interpret and encourage self -management treatment goals is suggested when appropriate. Examples of needed communication for alternative behaviors include a specific regimen relating to physical activity; a specific sodium-reduced meal plan indicating selections for breakfast, lunch, and dinner; lifestyle recommendations relating to sleep, rest, and relaxation; and finally, suggestions and alternatives to environmental barriers, such as barriers that prevent healthy food shopping or limit reliable transportation to and from appointments with health providers and pharmacy visits. 13.2. Access to Health Insurance and Medication Assistance Plans Health insurance and medication plan assistance for patients is especially important to improving access to and affordability of medical care and BP medications. Learni ng how the patient financially supports and budgets for his or her medical care and medications offers the opportunity to share additional insight relating to cost reductions, including restructured payment plans. Ideally, this would improve the patient’s compliance with medication adherence and treatment goals. by guest on November 13, 2017http://hyper.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from Whelton PK, et al. 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary Page 86 13.3. Social and Community Services Health care can be strengthened through local partnerships. Hypertensive patients, particularly patients with lower incomes, have more opportunity to achieve tr eatment goals with the assistance of strong local partnerships. In patients with low socioeconomic status or patients who are challenged by social situations, integration of social and community services offers complementary reinforcement of clinically ide ntified treatment goals. Social and community services are helpful when explicitly related to medical care. However, additional financial support and financial services are incredibly beneficial to patients, some of whom may choose to skip a doctor’s appointment to pay a residential utility bill. by guest on November 13, 2017http://hyper.ahajournals.org/Downloaded from Whelton PK, et al. 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline: Executive Summary Page 87 Table 22.

Although most ACC/AHA guideline writing committees are constituted such that no more than half the members may have relevant RWI for 1 year before and during development of the guideline, rules for the prevention guidelines require that no members have relevant RWI from 1 year before appointment until 1 year after publication of the guideline. Members’ RWI were reviewed and updated at all meetings and conference calls of the writing committee during the document development period. The complete ACC/AHA policy on RWI is available at http://www.acc.org/guidelines/about-guidelines-and-clinical-documents/relationships-with-industry-policy. We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of Dr. Lawrence Appel, who served as a member of the Writing Committee from November 2014 to September 2015. *Dr. David C. Goff resigned from the writing committee in December 2016 because of a change in employment before the recommendations were balloted. The writing committee thanks him for his contributions, which were extremely beneficial to the development of the draft.

Exclusion criteria: Prior CVD 1q endpoint: Cause-specific mortality Results: 958,074 persons followed for a mean of 12 y to death (12.7 million person-y at risk.

With progressively higher age, the BP-related proportional risk of vascular mortality was somewhat reduced but the corresponding absolute risk was much higher. • In adults aged 40–89 y, usual BP is strongly related to vascular (and overall) mortality, without evidence of a threshold down to at least an SBP/DBP of 115/75 mm Hg. Rapsomaniki E, et al., 2014 24881994 Study type: Observational cohort study Size: 1.25 million patients, in 225 primary care practices in the UK, followed for a median of 5.2 y using electronic medical records. Inclusion criteria: 0HQ\u0003DQG\u0003ZRPHQ\u0003\u0016\u0013\u0003 y, with no previous diagnosis of CVD, who had been registered at their practices for \u0014\u0003\\HDU\u0011 Exclusion criteria: N/A 1q endpoint: 12 acute and chronic CVD outcomes Results: 83,098 initial CVD events recorded. Within each of 3 age groups (30–59, 60–79, and \u001b\u0013\u0003y), the lowest risk for CVD was in those with a SBP 90–114 mm Hg and DBP 60–74 mm Hg. There was a direct relationship between level of BP and most CVD outcomes, with no evidence of J-curve, with the strongest relationship for SBP and stroke and weakest for abdominal aneurysm. • Despite modern treatments, the lifetime burden of BP- related CVD was substantial.

Ettehad D, et al., 2016 (17) 26724178 Aim: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to combine data from all published large-scale BP-lowering trials to quantify the effects of BP reduction on CV outcomes and death across various baseline BP levels, major comorbidities, and different pharmacological interventions. Study type: Meta- analysis of RCTs Size: 123 studies with 613,815 pts Inclusion criteria: • RCTs of BP-lowering treatment that included a minimum of 1,000 pt-y of follow-up in each study arm. No trials were excluded because of presence of baseline comorbidities, and trials of antihypertensive drugs for indications other than HTN were eligible. • Eligible studies fell into 3 categories: 1st, random allocation of pts to a BP-lowering drug or placebo; 2nd, random allocation of pts to different BP-lowering drugs; and third, random allocation of pts to different BP-lowering targets. Exclusion criteria: <1,000 pt y of follow-up in each treatment group. Intervention: BP-lowering meds Comparator: Placebo, active comparator or less intensive treatment 1q endpoint: • CVD. • Major CVD events, CHD, stroke, HF, renal failure, and all-cause mortality. • Standardized RR for 10 mm Hg difference in SBP • CVD RR: 0.80 (95% CI: 0.77–0.83) Other endpoints: CHD RR: 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78–0.88) Stroke RR: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.68–0.77) HF RR: 0.72 (95% CI: 0.67–0.78) Total deaths RR: 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84–0.91) Other results: • Benefit for CVD and other endpoints not different by baseline SBP, including <130 mm Hg fig 4 in paper CVD: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.50–0.80; p=0.22 CHD: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.42–0.72; p=0.93 Stroke: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.27–1.57; p=0.38 HF: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.41–1.70; p=0.27 Total deaths: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.37–0.76; p=0.79 • More precision around estimates of benefits in SBP 130–139 at baseline, fig 4 in paper • Results similar in trials of people with and without CVD at baseline figure 5 CVD+ 0.77 (95% CI: 0.71–0.81) • BP-lowering significantly reduces vascular risk across various baseline BP levels and comorbidities. Our results provide strong support for lowering BP to SBP<130 mm Hg and providing BP-lowering treatment to individuals with a history of CVD, CHD, stroke, DM, HF, and CKD. • In stratified analyses, we saw no strong evidence that proportional effects were diminished in trials that included people with lower baseline SBP (<130 mm Hg), and major CV events were clearly reduced in high-risk pts with various baseline comorbidities. Both of these major findings—the efficacy of BP-lowering below 130 mm Hg and the similar proportional effects in high risk populations—are consistent with and extend the findings of the SPRINT trial.

Law MR, et al., 2009 (18) 19454737 Study type: Meta- analysis of use of BP- lowering drugs in prevention of CVD from 147 randomized trials Size: Of 147 randomized trials of 464,000 pts, 37 trials of BBs in CAD included 38,892 pts, and 37 trials of other antihypertensive drugs in CAD included 85,395 pts Inclusion criteria: The database search used Medline (1966 to Dec. 2007) to identify randomized trials of BP-lowering drugs in which CAD events or strokes were recorded. The search also included the Cochrane Collaboration and Web of Science databases and the citations in trials and previous meta-analyses and review articles. Exclusion criteria: Trials were excluded if there were <5 CAD events and strokes or if treatment duration was <6 mo. 1q endpoint: CAD events; stroke Results: In 37 trials of pts with a history of CAD, BB reduced CAD events 29% (95% CI: 22%– 34%). In 27 trials in which BBs were used after acute MI, BB reduced CAD events 31% (95% CI: 24%–38%), and in 11 trials in which BB were used after long-term CAD, BB insignificantly reduced CAD events 13%. In 7 trials, BB reduced stroke 17% (95% CI: 1%–30%). CAD events were reduced 14% (95% CI: 2%–25%) in 11 trials of thiazide diuretics, 17% (95% CI: 11%–22%) in 21 trials of ACEIs, insignificantly 14% in 4 trials of angiotensin receptor blockers, and 15% (95% CI: 8%–22%) in 22 trials of CCB. Stroke was reduced 38% (95% CI: 28%–47%) in 10 trials of thiazide diuretics, 22% (95% CI: 8%–34%) in 13 trials of ACEI, and 34% (95% CI: 25%–42%) in 9 trials of CCB. • With the exception of the extra protective effect of BB given shortly after a MI and the minor additional effect of CCBs in preventing stroke, all the classes of BP-lowering drugs have a similar effect in reducing CAD events and stroke for a given reduction in BP.

Study type: Meta- analysis of RCTs Size: 32 RCTs with 104,359 pts Inclusion criteria: Intentional BP-lowering comparing active drug treatment with placebo, or less active treatment (intentional BP-lowering trials), or comparison of an active drug with placebo over baseline antihypertensive treatment, resulting in a BP difference of at least 2 mm Hg in either SBP or DBP (nonintentional BP-lowering trials); enrolling of hypertensive individuals only or a high proportion (at least 40%) of them. Exclusion criteria: N/A 1q endpoint: • As some trials were done on low-risk pts, others on higher risk pts, no evaluation of absolute risk- reduction was made. However, a 2º analysis was done including trials or trial subgroups with mean baseline SBP/DBP values in grade 1 range and a low-to-moderate risk (<5% CV deaths in 10 y in controls): FEVER stratum with baseline SBP below the median (<153 mm Hg); HTN Detection and Follow-up Program stratum with baseline DBP 90–94 mm Hg and no CVD; OSLO (e17); TOMHS (e28) and USPHS. Risks of stroke, CHD, the composite of stroke and CHD, and all-cause death were significantly reduced by BP-lowering in these low-to-moderate risk pts (control group: average CV mortality 4.5% in10 y) with a moderate BP elevation (average SBP/DBP 145.5/91 mm Hg) at randomization.

Inclusion criteria: Pts with HTN (on medications or t140/90) and Intervention: CPAP Comparator: Conservative treatment 1q endpoint: Decrease in BP Results: At 12 mo, CPAP decreased SBP by 1.89 mm Hg (95% CI: 3.90–0.11 mm Hg; p=0.065) and DBP 2.19 mm Hg Limitations: Not blinded; both groups consisted of pts with severe sleep- apnea. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 30 Study type: RCT Size: 359 pts; 12 mo of follow-up apnea-hypopnea index >19. (dietary counseling and sleep hygiene advice). (95% CI: 3.46– -0.93 mm Hg; p=0.001). The most significant reduction in BP was in pts who used CPAP for more than 5.6 h/night. Conclusions: CPAP induced a significant reduction in BP, albeit small, in hypertensive pts with OSA. Martinez-Garcia MA, et al., 2013 (58) 24327037 Aim: Assess the effect of CPAP on BP in pts with OSA and resistant hypertension. Study type: RCT Size: 194 pts; 3 mo follow-up Inclusion criteria: Pts with resistant hypertension and OSA. Intervention: CPAP Comparator: No therapy 1q endpoint: Change in 24-h ABPM from baseline to 12 wk. Results: • When the changes in BP were compared between groups by intent to treat, the CPAP group achieved a greater decrease in 24-h mean BP (3.1 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.6, 5.6); p=0.02) and 24-h DBP (3.2 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.0, 5.4; p=0.005) but not in 24-h SBP (3.1 mm Hg (95% CI: -0.6–6.7; p=0.10) compared to control. • There was also a greater nocturnal BP dipping pattern in CPAP treated pts than control (35.9% vs. 21.6%; adjusted OR: 2.4; CI: 1.2–5.1; p=0.02). • There was a significant positive correlation between h of CPAP use and the decrease in mean 24-h BP (r=0.29; 0.006), SBP (r=0.25; p=0.02) and DBP (r=0.30; p=0.005). Limitations: Did not use sham CPAP as placebo; open-label; short follow-up. Conclusions: Among pts with resistant hypertension and OSA, CPAP treatment for 12 wk compared with control resulted in a decrease in 24-h mean and DBP and improvement in nocturnal pressure pattern. Lozano L, et al., 2010 (59) 20577130 Aim: Assess effect of CPAP on pts with OSA and resistant hypertension. Study type: RCT Size: 96 pts; 3 mo of follow-up Inclusion criteria: Pts with resistant hypertension and OSA. Intervention: CPAP + conventional drug treatment Comparator: Conventional drug treatment alone 1q endpoint: Decrease in 24-h ABPM from baseline to 12 wk. Results: Pts with ABPM confirmed resistant hypertension treated with CPAP, unlike those treated with conventional therapy, showed a decrease in 24-h DBP (-4.9±6.4 vs. 0.1±7.3 mm Hg; p=0.027). Pts who used CPAP >5.8 h showed a greater reduction in daytime DBP (-6.12 mm Hg; 95% CI: -1.45–10.82; p=0.004), 24-h DBP (-6.98 mm Hg; 95% CI: -1.86– - 12.1; p=0.009) and 24-h SBP (-9.71 mm Hg; 95% CI: -0.20– -19.22; p=0.46). Limitations: Small study; only 3 mo follow-up; lack of sham control. Conclusions: CPAP as a complement to usual treatment improved mean 24-h DBP in pts with OSA and ABPM- confirmed resistant hypertension. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 31 Muxfeldt ES, et al., 2015 (60) 25601933 Aim: Evaluate the effect of CPAP on pts with resistant hypertension and OSA. Study type: RCT Size: 434 pts; 6 mo of follow-up Inclusion criteria: Pts with resistant hypertension and OSA Intervention: CPAP + conventional antihypertensive therapy Comparator: Antihypertensive therapy alone. Conventional antihypertensive therapy included spironolactone. 1q endpoint: BP reduction at 6 mo via ABPM Results: • On an intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant difference in any BP change, neither in nocturnal BP fall, between CPAP and control groups. The best effect of CPAP was on night-time SBP in per-protocol analysis, with greater reduction of 4.7 mm Hg (95% CI: -1.6%– 5.8%; p=0.25, in comparison with the control group. • Median use of CPAP was 4.8 h. Limitations: Nonblinded design; per protocol analysis underpowered to show the prespecified outcome of 6–7 mm Hg SBP differences between CPAP and control groups. Conclusions: CPAP had no significant effect on clinic or ambulatory BP in pts with resistant hypertension and moderately severe to severe OSA. However, in the specific subgroup of pts with uncontrolled ambulatory BP, CPAP may modestly reduce night-time SBP and improve the nocturnal BP fall pattern. The reason for lack of BP reduction in the overall study may have been due to excellent control of BP with median 5 medications, including spironolactone, in the majority of pts. Pedrosa RP, et al., 2013 (61) 23598607 Aim: Evaluate the effect of CPAP on pts with resistant hypertension and OSA. Study type: RCT with Size: 40 pts; 6 mo follow-up Inclusion criteria: Pts with resistant hypertension and OSA Intervention: CPAP + conventional antihypertensive therapy (n=20) Comparator: Antihypertensive therapy alone (n=20). 1q endpoint: BP reduction at 6 mo by ABPM. Results: BP was 162±4/97±2 mm Hg prior to randomization. CPAP was used for 6 h/night. Compared with the control group, awake SBP/DBP decreased significantly in the CPAP group (- 6.5±3.3/-4.5±1.9 vs. +3.1±3.3/2.1±2/7 mm Hg; p<0.05). BP changes were significant only when pts were awake but not at night by ABPM. Limitations: Small; but strength was rigorous exclusion of pts who were nonadherent; control arm did not undergo placebo treatment; nonblinded. Conclusions: Treatment of OSA with CPAP significantly reduces daytime BP in pts with resistant hypertension. Data Supplement 9.

At every level of sodium intake, the achieved reduction in SBP was greater on the control group compared to the DASH diet and for Blacks compared to other pts. • Reducing sodium intake from the high to intermediate level decreased SBP by 2.1 mm Hg (p<0.001) during the control diet and 1.3 mm Hg (p=0.03) during the DASH diet. • Reducing sodium intake from the intermediate low level decreased SBP by a further 4.6 mm Hg (p<0.001) during the control diet and 1.7 mm Hg (p<0.01) during the DASH diet. Safety endpoint: N/A Ɣ\u0003This trial provides the best (direct) evidence for a dose- response treatment relationship between sodium intake and level of BP. Ɣ\u0003It also suggests the relative effect of reduced sodium intake is greater in persons with a typical U.S. diet but the combination of sodium reduction and consumption of a DASH-type diet results in a lower level of BP than can be achieved with either dietary modification on its own. • Consistent with other trials and meta-analyses, it suggests the effect of a reduced sodium intake is greater in Blacks compared to others, especially for those consuming a typical U.S. diet.

Inclusion criteria: • $GXOWV\u0003\u0015\u0018\\ • Average SBP between 120–159 mm Hg and average DBP between 80–95 mm Hg • No use of antihypertensive medication • BMI between 18.5 and 45 kg/m2 Exclusion criteria: • Regular use of drugs that affect BP • Target organ damage or DM • Use of weight-loss meds • Hx CVD event • HF, angina, cancer, within 2 y • Consumption of >21 alcoholic drinks /wk • Pregnancy, planned pregnancy, lactation Intervention: • Structured behavioral interventions that used an identical format (4 individual and 14 group sessions) to facilitate adoption of “established” dietary recommendations for reduction in BP or “established” plus the DASH diet. The “established” dietary recommendations used in PREMIER were a) weight loss in overweight participants, b) sodium reduction, increased physical activity, reduced alcohol intake in pts consuming alcohol. • Compared to experience in the advice only (control) group, there was only modest achievement of 1q endpoint • Compared to control (advice only), SBP and DBP were significantly reduced with both active interventions but there was no significant difference in the effect size between the 2 active intervention groups. This was true for both the normotensive and hypertensive pts, with the effect size being larger in the hypertensive group. In the normotensives, the MD for change in SBP was identical for the “established” compared to “established plus DASH Diet” groups: -3.1 (95% CI: -5.1– -1.1) mm Hg The corresponding changes for DBP were -1.6 (95% CI: -2.9– -0.2) for the “established” intervention group and -2.0 (95% CI: -3.4– -0.6) for the “established intervention plus DASH Diet) group. • Overall, the incidence of HTN was lowest and the percent with optimal BP was highest in the “established plus DASH” diet but the incidence of Ɣ\u0003This was an interesting trial which employed a behavior change approach to implement both active interventions. Ɣ\u0003The investigators goal was to determine the additive value of the DASH Diet in persons already following key elements of conventional (established) recommendations for nonpharmacologic intervention to lower BP. Ɣ\u0003The intervention approach in this trial was less effective in achieving weight loss and reduction in dietary sodium compared to the corresponding experience in the TOHP and TONE trials and the DASH Diet effects on intermediate variables (such as fruit and vegetable consumption) was less than that achieved in the DASH Diet feeding studies. Ɣ\u0003Despite the modest intervention effects, both SBP and DBP were significantly reduced with the conventional intervention approach (in normotensives as well as overall) and addition of the DASH diet did not have a 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 47 intervention goals in the “established” group, with a MDs of 3.8 kg (8.4 lbs) for body weight, 11.6 mmol (267 mg)/d) for urinary sodium excretion, no change in physical activity (but better fitness), and no change in alcohol consumption (but very low alcohol consumption at baseline). • Weight loss was somewhat greater in the “established” plus DASH diet group, with a MD of 4.8 kg (10.6 lbs) for body weight. This group also manifested expected effects of the DASH diet, with significantly higher urinary potassium and phosphorous levels, greater consumption of fruits and vegetables, dietary calcium, dairy products, and a lower consumption of total fat and saturated fat. Comparator: Advice only HTN was significantly less and the percent with optimal BP was higher in both active intervention groups compared to advice only. The difference between the 2 active intervention groups was not significant. In the normotensives, there was a nonsignificant trend towards less HTN and a significantly higher percent with optimal BP in both active intervention groups compared to advice only, with no significant difference for percent with optimal BP in the 2 active intervention groups. 1q Safety endpoint: N/A significant effect on reduction of SBP or DBP. Ɣ\u0003There were some nonsignificant trends for slightly lower BP, less HTN, and more optimal BP in the “established plus DASH Diet” group compared to “established” group. The authors also cited use of the DASH Diet as a means to beneficially influence CVD risk factors in addition to BP.

However, the relationship between alcohol consumption and CVD is more complex as alcohol is associated with an apparently beneficial effect on CVD risk, possibly mediated by an increase in HDL-cholesterol. • Pregnant women, pts with HTN and those at risk of a drinking problem should not drink alcohol. Established light drinkers (<2 standard drinks/d in men and <1/d in women) who are normotensive are in a favorable risk category for CVD.

Inclusion criteria: • Healthy community- dwelling adults 30–54 y • BMI between 110% and 165% of desirable body weight • Not taking BP-lowering medication • Mean SBP <140 mm Hg and DBP 83-89 mm Hg Intervention: Behavior change intervention (combination of diet change and physical activity) aimed at studying the effects of a modest reduction in body weight during up to 48 mo (minimum 36 mo) of follow-up. 1q endpoint: Change in SBP • Compared to usual care, the weight loss group experienced a significant mean (standard error) reduction of -4.5 kg in body weight and -3.7 (0.5) (p<0.001) mm Hg in SBP at 6 mo (-6.0 mm Hg in the weight loss group and -2.2 mm Hg in the usual care group). • A progressive reduction in the effect sizes for body weight and BP • This was the largest trial of weight loss in prevention of HTN and also provides the longest duration of follow-up • The assumptions for a main effects factorial analysis (independence of the interventions) were not demonstrated. Given this finding, the most reliable analysis of this trial was comparison of the experience in each active intervention group with the usual care group. This results in a reduction in statistical power. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 65 Size: 2,382 pts, of whom 1,192 were randomized to weight loss and 1,190 were randomized to no weight loss intervention Exclusion criteria: • Taking antihypertensive medication • Heart disease, renal disease, poorly controlled hyperlipidemia or DM, DM requiring insulin, special dietary requirements • >14 drinks/wk. Comparator: Usual care group was noted over time, with mean (SD) for SBP at 18, 36 mo and termination of -1.8 (0.5) (p<0.001), - 1.3 (0.5) (p=0.01), and -1.1 (0.5) (p=0.04). Prevention of HTN • At 6 mo of follow-up the incidence of new onset HTN was 42% lower in the participants randomized to weight loss compared to the usual care group (p=0.02). • During more prolonged follow-up, the effect size decreased but remained borderline significant after 48 mo of follow-up (13% reduction; p=0.06). Overall, the incidence of HTN was reduced by 21% (p=0.02). Safety endpoint: N/A • Consistent with the pattern in the proceeding TOHP I trial weight loss reduced BP and the incidence of HTN but the effect sizes for weight loss and BP as well as the difficulty of maintaining the intervention in highly motivated and extensively counselled participants underscores the difficulty of achieving and maintaining ideal body weight in the general population by means of lifestyle change.

Thompson AM, et al., 2011 (113) 21364140 Aim: To evaluate the effect of antihypertensive treatment on 2º prevention of CVD events and all-cause mortality among pts without clinically defined HTN. Study type: Meta- analysis of RCTs Size: 25 RCTs with 64,162 pts Inclusion criteria: Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were RCTs of antihypertensive treatment among pts with BP <140 mm Hg systolic or <90 mm Hg diastolic for the prevention of CVD events (fatal or nonfatal stroke, fatal or nonfatal MI, CHF, or CVD mortality). Exclusion criteria: Studies were excluded if CVD events were not reported by HTN status in studies that included pts with and without HTN; the study population did not include pts with BP in the normal or prehypertensive ranges; the study population did not include pts with preexisting CVD or CVD equivalents, such as diabetes; antihypertensive treatment was not part of the intervention; treatment allocation was not random; a measure of variance (p-value or CI) was not reported or could not be calculated from the information provided; pts <18 y; or there were differences between Intervention: BP-lowering meds, the majority were studies of ACEI, next most common were BBs.

Similar results from studies of ACEI vs. other. These results support the Summary: Among pts with clinical history of CVD but without HTN, antihypertensive treatment was associated with decreased risk of stroke, CHF, composite CVD events, and all-cause mortality. Limitations: • Difference in achieved BP was not reported. • Average baseline SBP not reported. No information on the entry levels of BP other than not hypertensive. Difficult to use to establish a treatment threshold or goal. • Many of these studies were designed to try to demonstrate specific drug benefits rather than BP-lowering benefits. Can we attribute the benefits to BP- lowering? We know these pts did not have HTN but we do not know the lower limit of the BP inclusion ranges or the treatment associated difference in SBP between groups making it difficult to 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 70 intervention and control groups other than antihypertensive treatment. conclusion that the effect is not a drug effect, but is a BP-lowering effect, and that the effect is seen in people with CVD broadly defined, not just in HF pts. establish a treatment initiation threshold or goal. Xie X, et al., 2015 (21) 26559744 Aim: To assess the efficacy and safety of intensive BP-lowering strategies. Study type: Meta- analysis of RCTs Size: 19 RCTs with 44,989 pts Inclusion criteria: RCTs with at least 6 mo follow-up that randomly assigned pts to more intensive vs. less intensive BP- lowering treatment, with different BP targets or different BP changes from baseline. Reference lists from identified trials and review articles were manually scanned to identify any other relevant studies. Exclusion criteria: N/A Intervention: BP-lowering meds Comparator: • Less intensive treatment • BP difference 6.8/3.5 • The mean follow-up BP levels in the less intensive BP-lowering regimen group were 140/81 mm Hg, compared with 133/76 mm Hg in the more intensive treatment group. 1q endpoint: • CVD, other major CV events, defined as a MI, stroke, HF, or CV death, separately and combined; nonvascular and all-cause mortality; ESKD, and adverse events.

In high-risk pts, there are additional benefits from more intensive BP- lowering, including for those with SPB <140 mm Hg at baseline. The net absolute benefits of intensive BP- lowering in high-risk individuals are large. Limitations: • Lack of individual pt data, which would have allowed a more reliable assessment of treatment effects in different pt groups. • Interpretation: Supports treating pt with and without CVD at threshold of 130 to <130. Supports treating at threshold of about 130 even down to a CVD event rate of 0.9% per y. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 71 p-heterogeneity: 0.60 • Benefit for CVD not different for more intensive and less intensive targets in intensive group <140 or <150 mm Hg: 0.76 (95% CI: 0.60–0.97) <120– <130 mm Hg: 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84–1.00) p-hetero: 0.06 • Absolute benefits were proportional to absolute risk. • For trials in which all pts had vascular disease, renal disease, or DM at baseline, the average control group rate of major vascular events was 2·9% per y compared with 0·9% per y in other trials, and the numbers needed to treat were 94 (95% CI: 44–782) in these trials vs. 186 (95% CI: 107– 708) in all other trials. • Increase in severe hypotension: 0.3% vs. 0.1% per person y OR: 2.68 (95% CI: 1.21–5.89) Ettehad D, et al., 2015 (17) 26724178 Aim: This systematic review and meta- analysis aims to combine data from all published large-scale BP-lowering trials to quantify the effects of BP reduction on CV outcomes and death across various baseline BP levels, major comorbidities, and different pharmacological interventions. Inclusion criteria: • RCTs of BP-lowering treatment that included a minimum of 1,000 pt-y of follow- up in each study arm. No trials were excluded because of presence of baseline comorbidities, and trials of antihypertensive drugs for indications other than HTN were eligible. • Eligible studies fell into 3 categories: 1st, random allocation of pts to a BP-lowering drug or placebo; 2nd, random allocation of pts to different BP- Intervention: BP-lowering meds Comparator: Placebo, active comparator or less intensive treatment 1q endpoint: • CVD. • Major CVD events, CHD, stroke, HF, renal failure, and all-cause mortality. • Standardized RR for 10 mm Hg difference in SBP • CVD RR: 0.80 (95% CI: 0.77– 0.83) Other endpoints: • CHD RR: 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78– 0.88) • Stroke RR: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.68– 0.77) Summary: • BP-lowering significantly reduces vascular risk across various baseline BP levels and comorbidities. Our results provide strong support for lowering BP to SBP <130 mm Hg and providing BP-lowering treatment to individuals with a history of CVD, CHD, stroke, DM, HF, and CKD. • In stratified analyses, we saw no strong evidence that proportional effects were diminished in trials that included people with lower 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 72 Study type: Meta- analysis of RCTs Size: 123 studies with 613,815 pts lowering drugs; and third, random allocation of pts to different BP-lowering targets.

Both of these major findings—the efficacy of BP-lowering below 130 mm Hg and the similar proportional effects in high risk populations—are consistent with and extend the findings of the SPRINT trial. Limitations: • Lack of individual pt data, which would have allowed a more reliable assessment of treatment effects in different pt groups. • Interpretation: Lowering of BP into what has been regarded the normotensive range should therefore be routinely considered for the prevention of CVD among those deemed to be of sufficient absolute risk. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 73 • Some evidence of BB inferiority to other med classes in figure 6. • Did not report absolute risks so do not know lower level of risk in treated populations. SPRINT Wright JT Jr, et al., 2015 (114) 26551272 Aim: To test the effectiveness of a goal SBP<120 mm Hg vs. a goal SBP<140 mm Hg for the prevention of CVD in pts with 6%3130 mm Hg at baseline. Study type: RCT Size: 9361 pts followed median of 3.26 y. Inclusion criteria: 6%3130 mm Hg, with upper limit varying as number of pre-trial BP- lowering meds increased.

Summary: • More intensive SBP lowering to a goal of <120 mm Hg with achieved mean of approximately 121 mm Hg resulted in less CVD and lower total mortality over 3.26 y in comparison with a goal SBP <140 mm Hg and achieved SBP of ~135 mm Hg. • There were small increases in some expected SAEs. Perhaps unexpected, a sizable increase in reduced eGFR in the non-CKD group and AKI/ARF overall was observed in the intensive group. While of uncertain etiology and significance, there is speculation this could be an acute hemodynamic effect, especially given the findings regarding albuminuria. Limitations: Few pts were untreated at baseline ~9%, so SPRINT provides little if any insight at present regarding BP-lowering medication initiation for untreated people with SBP 130–139. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 74 • 1.7% fewer pts had orthostatic hypotension in intensive group; p=0.01. Lawes MR, et al., 2009 (115) 16222626 Aim: • To determine the quantitative efficacy of different classes of BP-lowering drugs in preventing CHD and stroke, and who should receive treatment. • 5 questions encapsulate this uncertainty. 1st, do BBs have a special effect over and above lowering BP in preventing CHD events in people with a history of CHD? 2nd, does the effect of BP- lowering drugs in preventing CHD and stroke differ in people with and without a history of CVD (i.e., is there a different effect in 2° and 1° prevention)? 3rd, does BP reduction alone explain the effect of BP-lowering drugs in preventing CHD and stroke? 4th, should the use of BP-lowering drugs be limited to people with high BP and not given to those at high risk of CVD Inclusion criteria: The database search (by MRL) used Medline (1966 to December 2007; any language) to identify randomized trials of BP-lowering drugs in which CHD events or strokes were recorded (irrespective of whether BP reduction was considered the mechanism of action). Search terms were “antihypertensive agents” or “HTN” or “diuretics, thiazide” or “adrenergic beta- antagonists” or “angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors” or “receptors, angiotensin/antagonists & inhibitors” or “tetrazoles” or “CCB s” or “vasodilator agents” or the names of all BP-lowering drugs listed in the British National Formulary as keywords or text words. Limits were Medline publication type “clinical trial” or “controlled clinical trial” or “RCT” or “meta-analysis”. We also searched the Cochrane Collaboration and Web of Science databases and the citations in trials and previous meta-analysis and review articles. Exclusion criteria: We excluded nonrandomized trials and trials in which treated groups but not control groups Intervention: BP-lowering medications Comparison: Placebo or less intensive treatment 1° endpoint: • CHD and stroke co-1° • Standardized to a 10/5 mm Hg BP reduction Overall CHD: 0.78 (95% CI: 0.73–0.83) Stroke: 0.59 (95% CI: 0.52–0.67) • In absence of vascular disease CHD: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.72–0.86) Stroke: 0.54 (95% CI: 0.45–0.65) • History of CHD CHD: 0.76 (95% CI: 0.68–0.86) Stroke: 0.65 (95% CI: 0.53–0.80) • History of stroke CHD: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.62–1.00) Stroke: 0.66 (95% CI: 0.56–0.79) • No big drug class effects except more benefit for BBs shortly after MI. • Treatment benefits seen down to pre-treatment SBP of 110–119 mm Hg for CHD events RR: 0.78 (95% CI: 0.63–0.96) and 130–139 mm Hg for stroke RR: 0.75 (95% CI: 0.63–0.89) Summary: The effect of BP- lowering drugs in reducing the risk of disease is entirely or largely due to BP reduction, with 1 main exception, a special extra effect of BBs in people who have had a recent MI The proportional reduction in CHD events and stroke for a given reduction in BP, an approximate halving in risk for each 10 mm Hg diastolic reduction, is the same in people with and without a history of vascular disease and in people without high BP as well as in those with high BP There is benefit in lowering BP in anyone at sufficient CV risk whatever their BP, so avoiding the need to measure BP routinely. Limitation: • Most of the pts without HTN were in the trials of people with pre-existing CVD; hence, most of the results of BP lowering in people with SBP<140 are in people with CVD. • No absolute risks or benefits provided. Not possible to estimate how far down the risk curve these results apply. Interpretation: This MA provides stronger support for 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 75 who have a lower BP? A corollary is whether BP should be reduced to a limited extent only, a treat to target approach. Although cohort (prospective\\observati onal) studies do not show a lower BP limit below which risk ceases to decline (“the lower the better”), this has not been shown in randomized trials across a wide range of BP. Finally, what is the quantitative effect of taking 1 BP-lowering drugs in lowering BP and preventing CHD events and stroke according to dose, pretreatment BP, and age? To date no such quantitative summary of effect, taking account of these determining factors, has been made. Study type: Meta- analysis of RCTs Size: 147 RCTs of BP- lowering meds and CHD events (22,000) and stroke (12,000). had other interventions as well as BP reduction, such as cholesterol reduction. We excluded trials in pts with chronic renal failure because these pts typically have high BP and high rates of CVD and their response to standard BP- lowering therapy may differ from other people. We also excluded trials in which fewer than 5 CHD events and strokes were recorded or the duration of treatment was less than 6 mo, as these data would contribute little to the overall results and substantially increase the complexity of the analyses. RCTs were otherwise included irrespective of pt age, disease status, BP before treatment, or use of other drugs. treating at levels <140 for people with CVD than for people without CVD. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 76 Lewington S, et al., 2002 (16) 12493255 Aim: To describe the age-specific relevance of BP to cause-specific mortality Study type: Meta- analysis of cohort studies Size: 61 prospective studies with 12.7 million person-y of observation, 56,000 vascular deaths in 40– 89 y. Inclusion criteria: Collaboration was sought from the investigators of all prospective observational studies in which data on BP, blood cholesterol, date of birth (or age), and sex had been recorded at a baseline screening visit, and in which cause and date of death (or age at death) had been routinely sought for all screens during more than 5,000 person-y of follow-up (see appendix A; http://image.thelancet.com/extra s/01art8300webappendixA.pdf). Relevant studies were identified through computer searches of Medline and Embase, by hand- searches of meeting abstracts, and by extensive discussions with investigators. Exclusion criteria: To minimize the effects of reverse causality (whereby established disease could change the usual BP), studies were excluded if they had selected pts on the basis of a positive history of stroke or heart disease, and individuals from contributing studies were excluded from the present analyses if they had such a history recorded at baseline. Intervention: N/A Comparator: N/A • The exposures of interest were the level of SBP and DBP and age-group. 1° endpoint: • Not completely clear, but for our purposes, stroke and IHD death would be co-1°.

Study type: Meta- analysis of RCTs Size: 32 RCTs with 104,359 pts with placebo over baseline antihypertensive treatment, resulting in a BP difference of at least 2 mm Hg in either SBP or DBP (nonintentional BP-lowering trials); enrolling of hypertensive individuals only or a high proportion (at least 40%) of them. Exclusion criteria: N/A (intentional BP-lowering trials), or comparison of an active drug with placebo over baseline antihypertensive treatment, resulting in a BP difference of at least 2 mm Hg in either SBP or DBP (nonintentional BP-lowering trials); enrolling of hypertensive individuals only or a high proportion (at least 40%) of them. Other inclusion criteria can be found in the preceding paper. 51 trials were found eligible either for assessing BP-lowering effects in different HTN grades or for assessing the effects of achieving different BP levels trials or trial subgroups with mean baseline SBP/DBP values in grade 1 range and a low-to-moderate risk (<5% CV deaths in 10 y in controls): FEVER stratum with baseline SBP below the median (<153 mm Hg) (e7); HTN Detection and Follow-up Program stratum with baseline DBP 90–94 mm Hg and no CVD (e9); OSLO (e17); TOMHS (e28) and USPHS (e29). Risks of stroke, CHD, the composite of stroke and CHD, and all-cause death were significantly reduced by BP-lowering in these low-to-moderate risk pts (control group: average CV mortality 4.5% in10 y) with a moderate BP elevation (average SBP/DBP 145.5/91 mm Hg) at randomization.

Study type: RCT Size: 11,140 pts with DM-2, from the ADVANCE trial Inclusion criteria: DM-2, aged 55 y, with a history of major macrovascular or microvascular disease, or at least 1 other risk factor for vascular disease Exclusion criteria: A definite indication for, or contraindication to, any of the study treatments, a definite indication for long-term insulin treatment or were participating in any other clinical trial. Intervention: Perindopril– indapamide or matching placebo 1q endpoint: • The Framingham equation was used to calculate 5-y CVD risk and to divide participants into 2 risk groups, moderate-to-high risk (<25% and no history of macrovascular disease), very high risk (>25% and/or history of macrovascular disease). • Endpoints were macrovascular and microvascular events. Summary: Relative effects of BP-lowering with perindopril– indapamide on CV outcomes were similar across risk groups whilst absolute effects trended to be greater in the high-risk group. Montgomery AA, et al., 2003 (119) 12923409 Aim: To estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BP-lowering treatment over a lifetime. Study type: Markov decision analysis model comparing treatment and nontreatment of HTN. Size: Hypothetical cohorts for 20 different strata of sex, age (30– 79 y, in 10-y bands), and CV risk (low and high) Inclusion criteria: We created models for 20 different strata of sex, age (age 30–70 y in 10-y bands), and 2 risk profiles (designated as ‘low’ and ‘high’ risk). These example risk profiles represent the extremes of absolute CV risk, based on data from the Health Survey for England and using a Framingham risk function. We recognize that the risk of most individuals seen in primary care will be somewhere between the examples presented here. The data included were as follows: age- and sex-specific mean SBP of untreated individuals with SBP>0.160 mm Hg were used for both high-risk and low-risk profiles. In addition, low-risk profile was defined as nonsmoker, 10th percentile total cholesterol 90th percentile HDL Intervention: Treatment and nontreatment of HTN. 1q endpoint: Life expectancy, and incremental cost: effectiveness ratios for treatment and nontreatment strategies • Probabilities of clinical events were obtained from published literature. Summary: • Incremental cost per quality- adjusted life y among low-risk groups ranged from £1,030 to £3,304. Cost-effectiveness results for low-risk pts were sensitive to the utility of receiving antihypertensive treatment. Treatment of high- risk individuals was highly cost- effective, such that it was the dominant strategy in the oldest age group, and resulted in incremental costs per quality- adjusted life y ranging from £34–£265 in younger age groups. • Policy decisions about which pts to treat depend on whether a life-expectancy or cost- 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 80 cholesterol, no DM, and no LVH, and high-risk profile was defined as smoker, 90th percentile total cholesterol, 10th percentile HDL cholesterol, DM, and LVH. Exclusion criteria: N/A effectiveness perspective is taken. Treatment increases life expectancy in all strata of age, sex, and CV risk. However, younger individuals stand to gain proportionately more from BP treatment than do the elderly. In terms of cost- effectiveness, pts at high risk of CVD are a highly cost- effective group to treat. In pts at lower risk of CVD, consideration should be given to issues of pt preference and cost. Kassai B, et al., 2005 (120) 17315403 Aim: Consideration of absolute risk has been recommended for making decisions concerning preventive treatment in HTN. Aim to estimate the benefit of antihypertensive therapy over a life- time. Study type: Meta- analysis on individual data in HTN and specific cause of death from national statistics. Disease-free survival curves until all pts have died were built using the “life-table” method. The treatment effect estimated from INDANA was applied to this curve to obtain the disease-free Inclusion criteria: To estimate the rate of cv and non-CV deaths in a hypothetical U.S. population of untreated hypertensive pts, we used the following procedure: age-specific death rates in the U.S. general population were obtained from national vital statistics (1994), and in untreated hypertensive population they were obtained from the control groups of the INDANA database. This latter group represents a unique cohort of 14 942 untreated or placebo-treated hypertensive pts, 26–96 y with an average follow-up of 5 y Exclusion criteria: N/A Intervention: The gain in life expectancy without stroke, CHD, and CV events was estimated from the area between the 2 survival curves of treated and control groups. The relative gain in life expectancy was defined as the ratio of gain in life expectancy to life expectancy. 1q endpoint: Stroke and CHD co- 1° Results: CHD Age ABb RGLEe Y RRa (%) NNTc GLEd (%) 40 0.86 0.3 333 20 4.1 50 0.88 1.0 100 17 4.3 60 0.90 1.9 53 13 3.4 70 0.91 3.9 26 10 5.4 Stroke Age ABb RGLEe Y RRa (%) NNTc GLEd (%) 40 0.80 0.4 250 32 5.9 50 0.84 1.0 100 26 5.7 60 0.86 2.3 44 21 7.1 70 0.87 5.7 18 17 9.1 a RR at 10 y b Absolute benefit at 10 y c NNT to avoid 1 event. d Gain in life expectancy in mo without events. Summary: Absolute gains in life expectancy are likely to be greater for younger, lower risk people with HTN than for older, higher risk people with HTN. However, the NNT to prevent an event will likely be greater especially in the short term in younger, lower risk people. This modeling analysis provides support for treating younger, lower risk individuals with HTN, but relies on the assumption that the relative benefits of treatments observed in short-term trials of higher risk individuals applies over a longer term to lower risk individuals. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 81 survival curve of the life-long treated population.

Czernichow S et al., 2011 (121) 20881867 Aim: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the relative reductions in risk achieved with different starting levels of BP (and treatment regimens). Study type: Meta- analysis of RCTs Size: 32 trials with 201,566 pts (20,079 1° outcome events) Inclusion criteria: RCTs of BP- lowering (drug vs. control or less intensive treatment) or different classes of drug therapy that included a minimum of 1,000 pt- y of follow-up in each study arm. Exclusion criteria: <1,000 pt-y of follow-up in each treatment group. Intervention: BP-lowering meds Comparator: Placebo, active comparator or less intensive treatment 1q endpoint: • Major CVD events (stroke, CHD, and HF. • No evidence of differences in the ratio of risk across varying levels of baseline BP (with all classes of BP- lowering medications). Summary: • Effectiveness of BP-lowering regiments in reducing RR of major CVD events does not seem to be influenced by starting level of BP. Limitations: • The majority of the participants studied were at high risk for CVD. • Information pertaining to the effect of treatment on absolute risk was not presented in this manuscript.

The search also included the Cochrane Collaboration and Web of Science databases and the citations in trials and previous meta-analyses and review articles. Exclusion criteria: Trials were excluded if there were <5 CAD events and strokes or if treatment duration was <6 mo. N/A 1q endpoint: CAD events; stroke Results: In 37 trials of pts with a history of CAD, BBs reduced CAD events 29% (95% CI: 22%, 34%). In 27 trials in which BBs were used after acute MI, BBs reduced CAD events 31% (95% CI: 24%–38%), and in 11 trials in which BBs were used after long-term CAD, BBs insignificantly reduced CAD events 13%. In 7 trials, BBs reduced stroke 17% (95% CI: 1%– 30%).

Randomized groups with a mean achieved SBP of 120 to 124 mm Hg had a hazard ratio (HR) for major cardiovascular disease of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.60–0.83) compared with randomized groups with a mean achieved SBP of 130 to 134 mm Hg, an HR of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.48–0.72) compared with those with a mean achieved SBP of 140 to 144 mm Hg, an HR of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.34–0.63) compared with those with a mean achieved SBP of 150 to 154 mm Hg, and an HR of 0.36 (95% CI: 0.26–0.51) compared with those with a mean achieved SBP of 160 mm Hg or more. • This study suggests that reducing SBP to levels below currently recommended targets significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and all- cause mortality and strongly support more intensive control of SBP among adults with hypertension. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 111 Data Supplement 32.

A nonlinear Cox proportional hazards model showed a nadir of 136/85 mm Hg (range 130–140/80–90 mm Hg) at which the incidence of 1° outcome was lowest. There was a relatively flat curve for SBP of 110–130 mm Hg and for DBP of 70–90 mm Hg, suggesting a BP <110/70 mm Hg may be dangerous. • After an ACS, a J- or U-shaped association existed between BP and the incidence of new CV events. The lowest incidence of CV events occurred with a BP of 130–140/80–90 mm Hg and a relatively flat curve for SBP of 110–130 mm Hg and of DBP of 70–90 mm Hg, suggesting a BP <110/70 mm Hg may be dangerous.

The search also included the Cochrane Collaboration and Web of Science databases and the citations in trials and previous meta-analyses and review articles. Exclusion criteria: Trials were excluded if there were <5 CAD events and strokes or if treatment duration was <6 mo. 1q endpoint: CAD events; stroke Results: In 37 trials of pts with a history of CAD, BBs reduced CAD events 29% (95% CI: 22%, 34%). In 27 trials in which BBs were used after acute MI, BBs reduced CAD events 31% (95% CI: 24%–38%), and in 11 trials in which BBs were used after long-term CAD, BBs insignificantly reduced CAD events 13%. In 7 trials, BBs reduced stroke 17% (95% CI: 1%–30%). CAD events were reduced 14% (95% CI: 2%–25%) in 11 trials of thiazide diuretics, 17% (95% CI: 11%– 22%) in 21 trials of ACEIs, insignificantly 14% in 4 trials of angiotensin receptor blockers, and 15% (95% CI: 8%–22%) in 22 trials of CCBs. Stroke was reduced 38% (95% CI: 28%–47%) in 10 trials of thiazide diuretics, 22% (95% CI: 8%–34%) in 13 trials of ACEIs, and 34% (95% CI: 25%–42%) in 9 trials of CCBs. • With the exception of the extra protective effect of BBs given shortly after a MI and the minor additional effect of CCBs in preventing stroke, all the classes of BP-lowering drugs have a similar effect in reducing CAD events and stroke for a given reduction in BP. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 112 Data Supplement 33.

Nonrandomized Trials, Observational Studies, and/or Registries of CKD (Section 9.3) Study Acronym; Author; Year Published Study Type/Design; Study Size (N) Patient Population Primary Endpoint and Results (include P value; OR or RR; & 95% CI) Summary/Conclusion Comment(s) Upadhyay A, et al., 2011 (179) 21403055 Aim: To summarize trials comparing lower vs. higher BP targets in pts with CKD; focus on proteinuria as an effect modifier Study type: Systematic review Size: 2,272 Inclusion criteria: >50 pts/group, 1 y follow-up, outcomes of death, kidney failure, CV events, change in kidney function, number of antihypertensive agents, adverse events. 3 trials (MDRD, AASK, REIN-2; 8 reports) Results: Overall trials did not show that BP target of <125/75–130/80 is more beneficial than a target of <140/90. Lower quality evidence suggests a low target may be beneficial in subgroups with proteinuria >300–1,000/d Limitations: No pts with DM-1 included. Duration (mean follow- up 2–4 y) may be too short to detect differences in clinically important outcomes. Reporting of adverse events not uniform. Summary: Available evidence is inconclusive but does not prove a BP target <130/80 improves clinical outcomes more than a target of <140/90 in adults with CKD. Lv, et al., 2013 (127) 23798459 Aim: To assess the renal and CV effects of intensive BP lowering in people with CKD Study type: Systematic review Size: 9,287 pts with CKD and 1,264 kidney failure events Inclusion criteria: • Randomized trials of pts with CKD assigned to different target BP that reported kidney failure and CV events. • 11 trials on 9,287 pts with CKD and 1,264 kidney failure events (doubling of serum creatinine, 50% decline in GFR or ESKD) • Included AASK, REIN-2, MDRD, Wuhl (children), Toto, Schrier plus 5 trials with CKD subgroups, also included the late nonrandomized follow-up studies for AASK and MDRD • BP targets varied substantially between trials. 2 trials targeted mean BP <92 mm Hg for the intensive treatment arm, and 107 mm Hg in the standard treatment arm. 1 trial aimed for BP<130/80 mm Hg vs. a DBP of 90 mm Hg, 1 study targeted <120/80 mm Hg vs. Results: Compared with standard regimens, more intensive BP lowering reduced risk of composite endpoint HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.68–0.98, and ESKD HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.67–0.93. Effect was modified by proteinuria (p=0.006) and markers of trial quality. Intensive BP lowering reduced the risk of kidney failure HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62–0.86 but not in pts without proteinuria at baseline HR: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.67–1.87. No clear effect on CV events or death. Limitations: All trials used open label, in 2 pts were blinded, substantial variability in design quality. There was substantial variability in BP targets by MAP, systolic and DBP or only DBP. Most trials did not include pts with diabetic kidney disease Summary: • Renal outcomes: 7 trials (N=5,308) recorded a total of 1,264 kidney failure events. A -7.7 mm Hg difference in SBP and a -4.9 mm Hg difference in DBP seen between treatment arms. Overall, a more intensive regimen reduced risk of composite kidney failure events by 17% HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.68–0.98, reduced the risk of ESKD alone by 18% (pooled HR for composite outcomes: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.67–0.93). • Intensive BP lowering had no effect on kidney failure in pts who did not have proteinuria (3 trials involving 1,218 pts HR: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.67–1.87), but it did reduce the risk of progressive kidney failure by 27% (5 trials involving 1,703 pts HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62–0.86 in people who did have proteinuria at baseline. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 134 135–140/85–90 mm Hg, and 4 studies had DBP<75–80 mm Hg vs. from 80–90 mm Hg. A trial involving pediatric pts targeted a 24-h mean BP<the 50th percentile, compared with the 50th to 95th percentiles in the control group. 2 trials had more liberal targets for intensive treatment (<140–150 mm Hg systolic, 85 mm Hg diastolic) • CV outcomes: major CV events reported in 5 trials (472 CV events in 5,308 pts with CKD). Intensive BP lowering did not reduce risk of CV events in pts with CKD, but the CIs remained wide RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.83–1.42. 6 trials reported stroke outcomes (197 events in 5,411 pts), 5 trials reported MI (138 events in 4,317 pts), and 5 trials reported HF (118 events in 5,308 pts). They saw no clear effect of intensive treatment on any of these vascular outcomes. • Death: 10 trials involving 6,788 participants reported 846 deaths. There was no clear effect of intensive BP lowering on risk of all-cause death RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.84–1.05) or CV death RR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.82–1.75 Jafar TH, et al., 2003 (180) 12965979 Aim: To determine the levels of BP and urine protein excretion associated with lowest risk for progression of CKD during antihypertensive therapy with and without ACEIs. Study type: 11 RCTs in pts with predominantly nondiabetic kidney disease Size: 1,860 pooled in pt level meta- analysis; mean duration of follow-up 2.2 y Inclusion criteria: • Pt-level meta-analysis using data from the AIPRD Study Group database to assess relationships among pts with nondiabetic kidney disease across a wide range of urine protein excretion values during antihypertensive therapy with and without ACEIs. • The AIPRD Study Group database included 1,860 pts with nondiabetic kidney disease enrolled in 11 RCTs of ACEIs to slow the progression of kidney disease. The database contained information on BP, urine protein excretion, serum creatinine, and onset of kidney failure during 22,610 visits. • Included only randomized trials (with a minimum 1 y follow-up) that compared the effects of antihypertensive regimens that included ACEIs with the effects of regimens that did not include ACEIs. HTN or decreased kidney function was required for entry into all studies. Exclusion criteria: Common to all studies: acute kidney failure, treatment with immunosuppressive meds, clinically significant chronic HF, obstructive uropathy, renal artery stenosis, active systemic disease, DM-1, history of transplantation, history of allergy to 1° endpoint: Progression of CKD defined as doubling of serum creatinine or onset of kidney failure Results: Kidney disease progression documented in 311 pts, 124 (13.2%) in the ACEI group and 187 (20.5%) in the control group (p=0.001). 176 (9.5%) developed kidney failure: 70 (7.4%) in the ACEI group and 106 (11.6%) in the control group (p=0.002). SBP of 110–129 mm Hg and urine protein excretion <2.0 g/d were associated with lowest risk for kidney disease progression. ACEI beneficial after adjustment for BP and urine protein excretion (RR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.53–0.84). The increased risk for kidney progression at higher SBP levels was greater in pts with urine protein excretion >1.0 g/d (p<0.006). Limitations: Studies included were not designed to assess the effect of lowering BP and urine protein excretion on kidney disease progression. Conclusions: Although reverse causation cannot be excluded with certainty, SBP goal between 110 and 129 mm Hg may be beneficial in pts with urine protein excretion >1.0 g/d. SBP <110 mm Hg may be associated with higher risk for kidney disease progression. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 135 ACEIs, and pregnancy. Giatras I, et al., 1997 (181) 9273824 Aim: To use meta- analysis to assess effects if ACEIs on development of ESRD in nondiabetic pts Study type: Meta- analysis Size: 1,594 pts from 10 studies Inclusion criteria: All randomized studies comparing ACEIs with other antihypertensive agents, with at least 1 y of follow-up Exclusion criteria: Studies of diabetic renal disease and renal transplants were excluded. Results: • Among 806 pts receiving ACEIs, 52 (6.4%) developed ESRD and 17 (2.1%) died. • In 788 controls, 72 (9.1%) developed ESRD and 12 (1.5%) died. The pooled RR were 0.70; 95% CI: 0.51–0.97 for ESRD and 1.24; CI: 0.55– 2.83 for death. • The decreases in weighted mean systolic and DBPs during follow-up were 4.9 and 1.2 mm Hg greater, respectively, in the pts who received ACEIs. Limitations: Included studies through 5/1996, published (7) and nonpublished (3) study results. Did not require that pts have HTN or renal insufficiency at baseline. Did not report results by severity of proteinuria related to the diseases included many of which are not characterized by proteinuria. Summary: ACEIs are more effective than other antihypertensive agents in reducing the development of end-stage nondiabetic renal disease, and they do not increase mortality. It could not be determined whether this beneficial effect is due to the greater decline in BP or to other effects of ACE inhibition. ONTARGET Investigators, et al., 2008 (126) 18378520 Aim: Evaluate whether use of an ARB was noninferior to ACEI, and whether the combination was superior to ACE alone in the prevention of vascular events in pts with CVD or DM but not HF.

Only 439 pts (0.3%) had eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline. Ɣ Limited numbers had proteinuria, present in 2,500 (7%) of 37161 pts with data available. Summary: Ɣ\u0003These analyses provided compelling evidence for the CV benefits of reduction in BP in pts with stage 1–3 CKD. The proportional reductions in risk of major CV events were similar in pts with and without evidence of CKD, however those with CKD stood to gain larger absolute benefits because their baseline risk was much higher. Ɣ\u0003BP-lowering is an effective strategy for preventing CV events among pts with moderately reduced eGFR. There is little evidence from these overviews to support the preferential choice of particular drug classes for the prevention of CV events in CKD.

Study type: Prospective, double-blind, RCT; multicenter phase II study. Size: 342 pts Inclusion criteria: Motor deficit, a cerebral CT scan excluding ICH, and necessity to treat HTN per prevailing recommendation Exclusion criteria: >85 y, disorders in consciousness preventing acquisition of consent, occlusion or >70% stenosis of the internal carotid artery, malignant HTN, manifest cardiac failure, high-grade aortic or mitral stenosis, UA pectoris, or contraindications against candesartan. Design: 4 mg candesartan daily or placebo on d 1. On d 2, dosage was increased to 8 or 16 mg candesartan or placebo if BP >60 mm Hg SPB or 100 mm Hg DBP. Treatment was targeted to a 10%–15% BP reduction within 24 h. 1q outcome: Trial was stopped prematurely when 342 pts (339 valid) had been randomized because of an imbalance in endpoints. Key findings: Cumulative 12 mo mortality and the number of vascular events differed significantly in favor of the candesartan cilexetil group (OR: 0.475; 95% CI: 0.252– 0.895).

No effect seen on vascular or all-cause mortality. ACEIs and diuretics separately, and particularly together, reduced vascular events, while beta-receptor antagonists had no discernable effect. Summary: Use of antihypertensive agents to lower BP for the prevention of vascular events in pts with previous stroke or TIA is efficacious.

Study type: Systematic review and meta-analysis Size: 10 RCTs Inclusion criteria: Pts with a history of ischemic stroke, TIA, or ICH Followed up 2 to 5 y. Exclusion criteria: N/A 1q outcome: Recurrent stroke Key findings: Antihypertensive drugs associated with significant reduction in recurrent strokes (RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.68– 0.90). Impact of antihypertensive treatment after ischemic stroke was similar in a restricted group of subjects with HTN and when all subjects, including those with and without HTN, were included. Pooled OR: 0.63 (95% CI: 0.54–0.73; p<0.0001) for trials involving diuretics as a component of therapy and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.87– 1.01; p=0.086) for trials in which treatment included renin system inhibitors (p<0.0001 for heterogeneity). 2q outcomes: Significant reduction in recurrent stroke seen with diuretics (alone or in combination with ACEIs) but not with renal artery stenosis inhibitors, BBs, or CCBs used alone; however, statistical power was limited, particularly for the assessment of BBs and CCBs. Summary: In conclusion, BP lowering by indapamide treatment reduced the recurrence of stroke and the incidence of CV events in Chinese pts with cerebrovascular disease. Whether prevention of stroke recurrence depends on drug class, degree of BP lowering or both requires further investigation.

After adjusting for covariates, compared with the high SBP group, the low to normal group had higher all-cause mortality AHR: 1.96 (95% CI: 1.13–3.39; p=0.017) and trended toward higher vascular mortality AHR: 2.08 (95% CI: 0.93–4.6; p=0.075). Compared with the normal BP group, the risk of all-cause and vascular mortality trended higher in low to normal BP group but did not achieve statistical significance. Summary: After stroke, compared with SBP in the high range, low to normal SBP may be associated with poorer mortality outcomes. Study limited by self-reported nature and retrospective design. Kim J, et al., 2014 (223) 24509123 Aim: To investigate the association between BP and vascular events up to 10 y after stroke. Study type: Analysis of population based study (North East Melbourne Stroke Incidence Study (NEMESIS) Inclusion criteria: 5-y survivors of stroke Categories: Stratification by quartiles of SBP Follow-up: Annually by telephone at 6, 8, and 9 y and face-to-face interview at 7 and 10 y after stroke. 1q outcomes: Composite of all-cause death or nonfatal vascular event (stroke or AMI); and all- cause death alone. Key findings: In 5-y survivors of stroke, compared to a SBP of 131–141 mm Hg, SBP of 120 mm Hg or less was associated with a 61% greater risk of stroke, acute MI and death (HR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.08–2.41; p௘=௘0.019). Compared to the reference category of SBP 131–141௘ mm Hg, there were no differences in outcome in the pts with SBP 121–130 ௘mm Hg (p௘=௘0.491) or 142–210௘ mm Hg (p௘=௘0.313). Findings were not modified after adjusting for antihypertensive drug prescriptions. Summary: There appears to be a greater risk of poor outcome in long-term survivors of stroke with low SBP. This is further evidence that low SBP may result in poor prognosis.

Study type: RCT Size: 11,140 pts, 4.3 y follow-up revascularization, or amputation for PVD) or at least 1 other risk factor (history of microvascular disease, microalbuminuria, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retinal photocoagulation therapy, macular edema, blindness, cigarette smoking, high cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, diagnosis of DM at least 10 y before enrollment or t65 y at entry Exclusion criteria: HbA1c target d6.5% or indication for insulin. vascular events decreased by 9% (HR: 0.91; (95% CI: 0.83, 1.00), p<0.04). Death from CVD decreased by 18%; RR: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.98) and death from any cause decreased by 14%; RR: 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.98). The effects of study treatment did not differ by initial BP or concomitant use of other treatments at baseline. The pts had at least 1 CV risk factor. • The ADVANCE trial included DM pts both with and without HTN. In this RCT, pts were randomized to active treatment or placebo rather than to a different BP goal, so that it is impossible to determine whether the benefit was due to the treatment of HTN per se. ACCORD Cushman WC, et al., 2010 (234) 20228401 Aim: To assess whether therapy targeting normal SBP (<120 mm Hg) reduces major CV events in DM-2 at high risk for CV events. Study type: RCT Size: 4,733 pts, 4.7 y follow-up Inclusion criteria: DM- 2 with HgbA1c t7.5%; t40 y with CVD or t55 y with anatomical evidence of atherosclerosis, albuminuria, LVH, or \u0015\u0003DGGLWLRQDO\u0003ULVN\u0003 factors for CVD. Exclusion criteria: BMI t45, serum creatinine >1.5, and other serious illness. • Pts were randomly assigned to intensive therapy SBP <120 mm Hg or standard therapy SBP <140 mm Hg. 1q outcomes: Nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or CV death. Results: Mean SBP in the intensive therapy group was 119.3 mm Hg and in the standard therapy group was 133.5 mm Hg. The annual 1° outcome 1.87% in the intensive therapy group and 2.09% in the standard therapy group HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.073–1.06; p=0.20. The annual rates of death from any cause were 1.28% and 1.19% in the 2 groups, respectively (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.39–0.89; p=0.01). Serious adverse events attributed to antihypertensive treatment occurred in 3.3% of the intensive therapy group and 1.3% of the standard therapy group (p<0.001). Limitations: This trial had an open label design. The rate of adverse events in the standard therapy group was less than expected. Pts younger than 40 y or older than 79 y were not included. Summary: In pts with DM-2 and high risk for CV events, targeting SBP of <120 as compared with <140 mm Hg did not reduce the rate of composite outcome of fatal and nonfatal major CV events and was associated with greater risk for adverse events. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 176 Margolis KL et al., 2014 (235) 24595629 Aim: To compare effects of combinations of standard and intensive treatment of glycemia and BP in the ACCORD trial. Study type: RCT Size: 4,733 pts, 4.7 y follow-up Inclusion criteria: Type 2 DM with HgbA1c t7.5%; t40 y with CVD or t55 y with anatomical evidence of atherosclerosis, albuminuria, LVH, or at least 2 additional risk factors for CVD. Exclusion criteria: BMI t45, serum creatinine >1.5, and other serious illness. • Pts were randomly assigned to intensive therapy SBP<120 mm Hg or standard therapy SBP<140 mm Hg. 1q outcomes: Nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or CV death. Results: In the BP trial, risk of the 1° outcome was lower in the groups intensively treated for glycemia HR: 0.67 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.91), BP HR: 0.74 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.00), or both HR: 0.71 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.96) compared with combined standard BP and glycemia treatment. For 2º outcomes, MI was significantly reduced by intensive glycemia treatment and stroke by intensive BP treatment; most other HRs were neutral or favored intensive treatment groups. Limitations: 2q analysis; results analyzed across individual cells of a factorial design with shorter follow- up than originally intended reducing power to detect meaningful differences and interactions; results may not apply to younger, healthier diabetics. Conclusions: Either intensive BP or glycemia control reduced major CVD compared with combined standard treatment, but the combination was no better than the individual intensive interventions. Soliman EZ et al., 2015 (236) 26459421 Aim: To compare effects of combinations of standard and intensive control of BP on the risk of LVH in the ACCORD trial. Study type: RCT Size: 4,331 pts, 4.7 y follow-up Inclusion criteria: DM- 2 with HgbA1c t7.5%; t40 y with CVD or t55 y with anatomical evidence of atherosclerosis, albuminuria, LVH, or at least 2 additional risk factors for CVD. Exclusion criteria: BMI t45, serum creatinine >1.5, and other serious illness. • Pts were randomly assigned to intensive therapy SBP<120 mm Hg or standard therapy SBP<140 mm Hg. 1q outcomes: Nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or CV death. Results: The outcome measures were electrocardiographic LVH defined by Cornell voltage (binary variable) and mean Cornell index (continuous variable). The baseline prevalence of LVH (5.3% vs. 5.4%; p=0.91) and the mean Cornell index (1,456 vs. 1,470 µV ; p = 0 . 4 5 ) w e r e similar in the intensive (n=2,154) and standard (n=2,177) BP- lowering arms, respectively. However, after median follow-up of 4.4 y, intensive, compared with standard, BP lowering was associated with a 39% lower risk of LVH (OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.43–0.88; p=0.008) and a significantly lower adjusted mean Cornell index (1,352 vs. 1,447 µ V; p<0.001). The lower risk of LVH associated with intensive BP lowering during follow-up was because of more regression of baseline LVH and lower rate of developing new LVH, compared with standard BP lowering. No interactions by age, sex, or race were observed. Limitations: 2º analysis; open-label design; LVH defined by EKG and not by echo or cardiac MRI; results may not apply to younger, healthier diabetics. Conclusions: Targeting a SBP of <120 mm Hg when compared with <140 mm Hg in pts with HTN and DM produces a greater reduction in LVH 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 177 Xie X, et al., 2015 (21) 26559744 Aim: To assess the efficacy and safety of intensive BP lowering strategies. Study type: Systematic review and meta-analysis Size: 19 trials with 44,989 pts; 3.8 y of follow-up. Inclusion criteria: RCTs with different BP targets or different BP changes between more vs. less intense therapy with at least 6 mo follow-up. Exclusion criteria: Trials that did not assess a different target or relevant outcome. • 5 RCTs (6,960 pts) enrolled only pts with DM and 6 trials (2,809 pts) specifically recruited pts with CKD. 1q outcomes: Major CV events, defined as MI, stroke, HF or CV death, separately and combined; nonvascular and all-cause mortality; ESKD; and adverse events; new onset microalbuminuria/macroalbuminuria or change from micro- to macroalbuminuria and retinopathy in pts with DM. Results: Pts in the more intensive BP- lowering treatment group had mean BP 133/76 mm Hg compared with 140/81 mm Hg in the less intensive group. Intensive BP- lowering treatment achieved RR reductions for major CV events: 14% (95% CI: 4–22), MI: 13% (95% CI: 0–24), stroke: 22% (95% CI: 10–32), albuminuria: 10% (95% CI: 3– 16), and retinopathy progression: 19% (95% CI: 0–34). However, more intensive treatment had no clear effects on HF: RR: 15% (95% CI: -11–34), CV death: 9% (-11– 26), total mortality: 9% (95% CI: -3–19), or ESKD: 10% (95% CI: -6–23). The reduction in major CV events was consistent across pt groups, and additional BP lowering had a clear benefit even in pts with SBP <140 mm Hg. The absolute benefits were greatest in trials in which all enrolled pts had vascular disease, renal disease, or DM. Serious adverse events associated with BP lowering were only reported by 6 trials and had an event rate of 1%–2% per y in intensive BP lowering group pts, compared with 0.9% in the less intensive treatment group (RR: 1.35; 95% CI: 0.93–1.97). Severe hypotension was more frequent in the more intensive treatment regimen (RR: 2.68; 95% CI: 1.21– 5.89; p=0·015), but the absolute excess was small (0.3% vs. 0.1% per pt-y for the duration of follow-up). Study limitations: Only 6,960 pts with DM were included in the total study size of 44,989 pts. Conclusions: The absolute CV benefits were greatest in trials in which all enrolled pts had vascular disease, renal disease or DM. However, only 6,960 of the 44,989 pts had DM and no sub-analysis for DM was provided; however, the outcome benefits were qualitatively most striking for pts with DM, CKD and/or vascular disease. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 178 ACCOMPLISH Weber MA, et al., 2010 (237) 20620720 Aim: To determine which combination therapy in pts with HTN and DM most effectively decreases CV events. Study type: RCT Size: 2,842 pts with DM from the ACCOMPLISH study of 6,946 pts; 30 mo follow-up Inclusion criteria: HTN and DM with high risk for CV events. Exclusion criteria: BMI >45; serum Cr >1.5; other serious illness • Pts were randomly assigned to benazepril plus amlodipine or benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide. BPs were 145/79 at baseline. 1q outcomes: Composite of death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for angina, resuscitation after sudden cardiac arrest, and coronary revascularization. Results: The mean achieved BP was 131.5/72.6 and 132.7/73.7 in the B + A and B + H groups, respectively, during the 30 mo of follow-up. There were 8.8% and 11% 1° events, respectively (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.684–0.92; p=0.003). In the pts with DM there were clear coronary benefits with B + A, including both acute clinical events (p=0.013 and revascularizations (p=0.024). There were no unexpected adverse events. Summary: In pts with DM and HTN, combining an ACEI with a CCB, compared with hydrochlorothiazide, was superior in reducing CV events. ASCOT Ostergren J, et al., 2008 (238) 18854748 Aim: To compare the effects of an amlodipine-based regimen vs. and atenolol-based regimen on CV outcomes in pts with DM Study type: RCT (BP lowering arm of ASCOT) Size: 5,137 pts with DM, minimum 4 y follow-up Inclusion criteria: Pts 40–65 y with HTN (>160/100 mm Hg) or treated HTN and DM plus 2 additional CV risk factors: PAD, previous stroke or TIA, PDOH\u0003VH[\u000f\u0003\u0018\u0018\u0003\\\u000f\u0003 microalbuminuria, smoking, total cholesterol to HDL ratio \u0019\u000f\u0003RU\u0003Iamily history of CHD. • Pts were randomly assigned to an amlodipine- based regimen with addition of perindopril as required or an atenolol-based regimen with addition of a thiazide as required and therapy titrated as required to achieve target BP of 130/80 mm Hg. 1q outcomes: Fatal CHD and nonfatal MI. Results: BPs were 136/75 (amlodipine and 137/76 (atenolol) at the end of study. There was a 3/1.9 mm Hg lower BP in pts on amlodipine. The amlodipine-based regimen reduced CV events and procedures compared to the atenolol-based regimen (HR 0.86; 0.76-0.98; p=0.026). Fatal and nonfatal strokes were reduced by 25% (p=0.017), PAD by 48% (p=0.004) and noncoronary vascularization procedures by 57% (p=0.001). Summary: In the large DM subgroup of the BP-lowering arm of ASCOT, the benefits of an amlodipine-based treatment compared with an atenolol-based treatment on the incidence of total CV events and procedures was significant. SHEP Kostis JB, et al., 2005 (239) 15619390 Aim: To assess the long-term mortality rate of pts with DM pts in the SHEP trial randomly assigned to stepped care with chlorthalidone or placebo.

Exclusion criteria: Pts with insulin–dependent DM and those who • Pts were randomly assigned to chlorthalidone or placebo. If BP remained above goal, atenolol or placebo was added. 1q outcomes: CV mortality rate Results: BP was 11.1/3.4 mm Hg lower in the active treatment group at the end of the study. Diuretic treatment in pts with DM was strongly associated with long-term CV mortality rate (AHR: 0.668 (95% CI: 0.526, Summary: Chlorthalidone-based treatment improved long-term outcomes in pts with DM. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 179 Study type: RCT Size: 4,732 pts; follow-up 14.3 y required diuretic therapy. 0.848) and total mortality rate: 0.805 (95% CI: 0.680, 0.952).

Results: Average BP was 126.3/74.7 and 129.5/76.6, respectively (significant not stated). Olmesartan delayed the onset of microalbuminuria by 25% (0.75; 95% CI: 0.61–0.92; p=0.007). CV events were comparable in the 2 groups. Summary: Pts with better BP reduction are less likely to develop microalbuminuria. Treatment with an ARB delayed the onset of microalbuminuria independently of baseline BP and degree of BP reduction. ABCD Estacio RO, et al., 1998 (241) 9486993 Aim: To compare the effects of “intensive” compared with “moderate” BP treatment on 24-h creatinine clearance (GFR) in pts with DM and HTN.

Results: • The mean BP achieved was 132/78 in the intensive group and 138/86 in the moderate control group. During the 5-y follow-up period, there was no difference in GFR between the groups. After the first y of antihypertensive treatment, GFR stabilized in both the intensive and moderate groups with normal albumin excretion or microalbuminuria. In contrast, pts with overt albuminuria demonstrated steady decline in GFR whether on intensive or moderate therapy. Neither was there a significant difference in the progression from normal to micro- or micro-to overt albuminuria. • Intensive therapy demonstrated a lower overall incidence of deaths, 5.5% vs. 10.7%; p=0.037 (2q endpoint). Limitations: Open-label design; the definition of DM was 2 fasting blood glucose measurements >140 mg/dL as opposed to >126 today; serious side effects were not reported. Risk of bias due to a greater proportion of pts with established CVD at baseline assigned to the standard BP target. Summary: BP control of 138/86 or 132/78 with either nisoldipine or enalapril as the initial antihypertensive agent appeared to stabilize renal function in HTN pts with type 2 DM without overt albuminuria over a 5-y period. For the ABCD trials, only ABDC (H) included strictly pts with HTN and DM. The quality of evidence is low due to imprecision and risk of bias.

UKPDS 1998 (243) 9732337 Aim: To determine whether tight control of BP prevents macrovascular and microvascular complications in pts with DM-2. Study type: RCT Size: 1,148 hypertensive pts with type 2 DM Follow-up: 8.4 y Inclusion criteria: Fasting plasma glucose concentration >6 mmol/l in 2 mornings. Exclusion criteria: Ketonuria >3 mmol/l; history of MI in the previous y; current angina or HF; >1 major vascular episode; serum creatinine concentration >175 µ mol/l; retinopathy requiring laser treatment; malignant HTN; an uncorrected endocrine abnormality; an occupation that would preclude insulin treatment; a severe concurrent illness; inadequate understanding or unwillingness to enter the study. • Pts were randomized to tight BP control (target BP<150/85 mm Hg) or less tight BP control (target <180/105 mm Hg), 1q outcomes: 1) First clinical endpoint related to DM (sudden death, death from hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, fatal or nonfatal MI, angina, HF, stroke, renal failure, amputation, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal photocoagulation, blindness in 1 eye or cataract extraction). 2) Death related to DM. 3) Death from all causes. Results: BP in the tight BP control group was 144/82 compared with the group assigned less tight control (154/87), p<0.0001. Reductions in risk in the group assigned tight BP control compared with those of the less tight control group were 24% (95% CI: 8%–38%; p=0.0046) in DM related endpoints; 32% in deaths related to DM (95% CI: 6%–51%; p<0.019; 44% in strokes (95% CI: 11%–65%; p<0.013; and 37% (95% CI: 11%–36%; p<0.0092 in microvascular endpoints, predominantly due to risk of retinal photocoagulation. Limitations: DBP targets were high (85 mm Hg in the tight control group and 105 mm Hg in the less tight control group) and similar to the cutoffs for the no treatment groups in trials comparing treatment with no treatment. UKPDS evaluated lowering both SBP and DBP so it is impossible to separate the outcomes effects of DBP. Therefore, the evidence is of low quality. Summary: Tight BP control in pts with HTN and DM-2 achieved a clinically important reduction in the risk of death related to DM, complications related to DM, progression of DM retinopathy and deterioration of visual acuity, but the quality of evidence is low. Arguedas JA, et al., 2013 (244) 24170669 Aim: To determine if “lower” BP targets (any target <130/85 Inclusion criteria: RCTs in which individuals were • Pts with HTN and DM were randomly assigned to the 1q outcomes: Total mortality, total serious adverse events, MI, stroke, CHF, and ESRD.

Excluded studies were UKPDS 1998, HTN in Diabetes Study IV 1996, SANDS 2008, Lewis 1999 and the Steno-2 study. intensive or standard BP control group. Results: Only 1 trial (ACCORD) compared outcomes associated with 'lower' (<120 mm Hg) or 'standard' (<140 mm Hg) SBP targets in 4734 pts. Despite achieving a significantly lower BP (119.3/64.4 mm Hg vs. 133.5/70.5 mm Hg, p<0.0001), and using more antihypertensive medications, the only significant benefit in the group assigned to 'lower' SBP was a reduction in the incidence of stroke: RR: 0.58; (95% CI: 0.39–0.88; p=0.009), absolute risk reduction 1.1%. The effect of SBP targets on mortality was compatible with both a reduction and increase in risk: RR: 1.05 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.30), low quality evidence. Trying to achieve the 'lower' SBP target was associated with a significant increase in the number of other serious adverse events: RR: 2.58, (95% CI: 1.70–3.91; p<0.00001, absolute risk increase 2.0%. 4 trials (ABCD-H, ABCD-N, ABCD-2V, and a subgroup of HTN Optimal Treatment) specifically compared clinical outcomes associated with 'lower' vs. 'standard' targets for DBP in pts with DM. The total number of pts included in the DBP target analysis was 2580. Pts assigned to 'lower' DBP had a significantly lower achieved BP: 128/76 mm Hg vs. 135/83 mm Hg; p<0.0001. There was a trend towards reduction in total mortality in the group assigned to the 'lower' DBP target: RR: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.53–1.01), mainly due to a trend to lower non-CV mortality. There was no difference in stroke: RR: 0.67, (95% CI: 0.42–1.05), in MI: RR: 0.95 (95% CI: 0.64– 1.40) or in CHF: RR: 1.06 (95% CI: 0.58– 1.92), low-quality evidence. End-stage renal failure and total serious adverse events were not reported in any of the trials. A sensitivity analysis of trials comparing DBP targets <80 mm Hg (as suggested in clinical guidelines) than standard targets in pts with HTN and DM. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 182 vs. <90 mm Hg showed similar results. There was a high risk of selection bias for every outcome analyzed in favor of the 'lower' target in the trials included for the analysis of DBP targets. Palmer SC, et al., 2015 (245) 26009228 Aim: To investigate the benefits and harms of BP- lowering drugs in adults with DM Study type: Network meta-analysis of RCTs. Size: 157 studies in 43,256 pts mostly with DM and CKD. Mean follow-up: 4.5 y Inclusion criteria: Pts \u0014\u001b\u0003\\\u0003ZLWK\u0003'0\u0003DQG\u0003 CKD and were treated in clinical trials that compared any orally administered antihypertensive agent alone or in combination with a 2nd antihypertensive agent or combination, placebo, or control. Exclusion criteria: Pts who underwent kidney transplantation or dialysis. N/A 1q outcomes: All-cause mortality and ESKD (need for dialysis or transplantation). Results: No drug regimen was more effective than placebo for reducing all-cause mortality. However, compared with placebo, ESRD was significantly less likely after dual treatment with an ARB and an ACEI: OR: 0.62 (95% CI: 0.43–0.90) and after ARB monotherapy: OR: 0.77 (95% CI: 0.65–0.92). No regimen significantly increased hyperkalemia or acute kidney injury, although combined ACEI and ARB treatment had the lowest rank among all interventions because of borderline increases in estimated risks of these harms; OR: 2.69 (95% CI: 0.97–7.47) for hyperkalemia; OR: 2.69 (95% CI: 0.98– 7.38) for acute kidney injury. Limitations: Effects of BP treatment on CV events and related mortality were uncertain. Data for the outcome of ESKD were restricted largely to pts with macroalbuminuria. Acute kidney injury was poorly defined with low quality of evidence. Conclusions: No BP-lowering strategy prolonged survival in adults with DM and CKD. ACEIs and ARBs, alone or in combination, were the most effective strategies against ESKD. Any benefits of combined ACEI and ARB treatment need to be balanced against potential harms of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. Turnbull F, et al., 2005 (246) 15983291 Aim: To determine the benefits associated with different treatment regimens in pts with and without DM and whether there are important differences in the effects of different BP-lowering regimens in these 2 pt groups. Study type: Meta- analysis of RCTs. Inclusion criteria: Randomization of pts between a BP-lowering agent and a control (placebo or less intensive BP-lowering regimen) or randomization of pts between regimens based on different classes of BP-lowering drugs. Exclusion criteria: Studies not meeting the above criteria. N/A 1q outcomes: Nonfatal stroke or death from cerebrovascular disease; nonfatal MI or death from CAD; HF causing death or requiring hospitalization; total CV events; total CV deaths; and total mortality. Results: Total major CV events were reduced to a comparable extent in individuals with and without DM by regimens based on ACEIs, calcium antagonists, ARBs and diuretics/ BBs (p<0.19 for all). There was limited evidence that lower BP goals produced larger reductions in total major CV events in pts with vs. without DM (p<0.03). Limitations: No analysis of renal outcomes, risk of new DM or progression of existing DM; combined comparison of persons taking diuretics and BB s; some studies selected pts on the basis of the presence or absence of DM. Summary: Effects of BP-lowering agents on major CV events were broadly comparable for pts with and without DM. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 183 Size: 27 RCTs including 158,709 pts (33,395 with DM and 125,314 without DM).

A significantly higher RR was noted for the 1° outcome in IFG pts assigned to amlodipine vs. chlorthalidone. Stroke was more common in NG pts assigned to lisinopril vs. chlorthalidone RR: 1.31 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.57). HF was more common in DM and NG pts assigned to amlodipine RR: 1.39 (95% CI: 1.22, 1.59) and 1.30 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.51), respectively or lisinopril: 1.15 (95% CI: 1.00–1.32) and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.39), respectively vs. chlorthalidone. Limitations: Microalbuminuria was not measured. Summary: Our results provide no evidence of superiority for treatment with CCBs or ACEIs compared with a thiazide-type diuretic during first- step antihypertensive therapy in DM, IFG, or NG.

Study type: Observational analysis Size: 8,811 pts Inclusion criteria: Pts had not experienced major macro- or microvascular events during first 2 y of the ADVANCE trial Exclusion criteria: None 1q endpoint: Composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, new or worsening nephropathy, or retinopathy. Results: Major macro- and micro-vascular events were associated with SBP variability even after adjustment for mean SBP and other confounding factors. For the highest 10% variability, HR: 1.54 (95% CI: 0.99, 2.39) for macrovascular events; for microvascular events, HR: 1.84 (95% CI: 1.19, 2.84). Summary: Visit-to-visit SBP variability and maximum SBP are independent risk factors for macro- and micro-vascular events. ADVANCE-ON Zoungas S, et al., 2014 (249) 25234206 Aim: To determine whether the mortality benefit that had been observed among pts originally assigned to BP- lowering therapy were still evident at the end of 6-y follow-up Study type: Observational analysis Size: 8,494 pts Inclusion criteria: Pts with DM who participated in post- trial follow-up for 6 y Exclusion criteria: See above 1q endpoint: Death from any cause and major macrovascular complications (a composite of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or death from any CV cause. Results: The reductions in the risk of death from any cause and of death from CV causes that had been observed in the group receiving active BP-lowering treatment during the ADVANCE trial were attenuated but significant at the end of the post-trial follow- up. HRs were 0.95 (95% CI: 0.84–0.99; p=0.03) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.77–0.99; p=0.04), respectively. Summary: Benefits were attenuated but still present at the end of 6 y. ROADMAP Mene J, et al., 2014 (250) 24772521 Aim: To determine whether the ROADMAP olmesartan medoxomil treatment resulted in a potential long-term micro- and macro-vascular benefit. Study type: Observational analysis Size: 1,758 pts; 3.3 y follow- up Inclusion criteria: See above Exclusion criteria: See above 1q endpoint: See above Results: The original ROADMAP study showed a 23% reduction in microalbuminuria despite good and comparable BP control in both groups. Pts who developed microalbuminuria had a higher incidence of cardio- and cerebrovascular events: OR: 1.77 (95% CI: 1.03–3.03; p=0.039) compared to those in whom this was not the case. DM retinopathy and HF requiring hospitalization also were reduced. Summary: renal artery stenosis blockade might cause a sustained reduction in micro- and macro-vascular events. Edmin C, et al., 2015 (251) Aim: Determine associations between BP-lowering Inclusion criteria: All RCTs of BP-lowering treatment in • BP-lowering drug vs. placebo: 26 RCTs Limitations: Reliability of this meta-analysis is limited by the scarcity of large trials with 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 185 25668264 treatment and presence of vascular disease in DM-2 Study type: Large meta- analysis of 40 high quality RCTs (1/1966– 10/2014) judged low risk of bias Size: 100,354 pts with DM; all trials >1,000 pt-y of follow-up BP-lowering drug vs. placebo: 26 RCTs • More intensive vs. less intensive BP lowering: 7 RCTs • BP-lowering vs. another drug: 17 RCTs which entire trial population had DM-2 or in which the results of a DM subgroup were obtained. Studies were included regardless of the presence or absence of defined HTN. Exclusion criteria: Trials conducted predominantly in pts with type 1 DM were excluded. • More intensive vs. less intensive BP lowering: 7 RCTs • BP-lowering vs. another drug: 17 RCTs Results: Baseline BP: A 10-mm Hg SBP reduction was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality RR: 0.87 (95% CI: 0.78–0.96), CVD events RR: 0.89 (95% CI: 0.80–0.98), and stroke events RR: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.64–0.83). The associations for HF and renal failure were not significant. For microvascular events, a 10-mm reduction in SBP was associated with a lower risk of retinopathy RR: 0.87 (95% CI: 0.76–0.99) and albuminuria RR: 0.83 (95% CI: 0.79–0.87). Stratified by initial SBP: Trials stratified by SBP >140 to <140 mm Hg showed significant interactions for all-cause mortality RR: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.64–0.84) vs. 1.07 (95% CI: 0.92–1.26), CVD RR: 0.74 (95% CI: 0.65–0.85) vs. RR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.88–1.05), CHD RR: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.61– 0.87) vs. RR: 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86–1.10), HF RR: 0.75 (95% CI: 0.59–0.94) vs. RR: 0.97 (95% CI: 0.79–1.19) and albuminuria RR: 0.71 (95% CI: 0.63–0.79) vs. RR: 0.86 (95% CI: 0.81–0.99). Stratified by achieved SBP: Trials stratified by SBP achieved in the treatment group t130 or <130 mm Hg and the associations of a 10-mm Hg SBP reduction compared between the strata showed significant interactions for all-cause mortality RR: 0.75 (95% CI: 0.65–0.86) vs. RR: 1.06 (95% CI: 0.90–1.265), CVD RR: 0.74 (95% CI: 0.64–0.85) vs. RR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.88–1.05), CHD RR: 0.70 (95% CI: 0.58– 0.83) vs. RR: 0.97 (95% CI: 0.85–1.10), HF achieved SBP levels in the 120–130 mm Hg range. The relatively short follow-up of included trails may have prevented associations of BP-lowering treatment with vascular outcomes from being observed, particularly for outcomes such as HF and renal failure, which are often a consequence of MI or albuminuria, respectively. Summary: • This large meta-analysis of 40 RCTs provides evidence that BP lowering is associated with lower risks of outcomes in pts with initial mean SBP t140 mm Hg compared with those <140 mm Hg with the exception of stroke, albuminuria and retinopathy. When trials were stratified by achieved SBP treatment was associated with lower risks only in the <130 mm Hg stratum for stroke and albuminuria. • This meta-analysis shows that although BP lowering was not associated with a lower risk of CVD or CHD events at a baseline SBP <140 mm Hg, it does observe lower risks of stroke, retinopathy and progression of albuminuria. • This study provides evidence that for individuals at high risk for these outcomes (history of cerebrovascular disease or mild nonproliferative retinopathy), commencement of therapy below an initial SBP of 140 mm Hg and treatment to SBP <130 may be indicated. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 186 RR: 0.75 (95% CI: 0.59–0.95) vs. RR: 1.00 (95% CI: 0.81–1.23) and albuminuria RR: 0.71 (95% CI: 0.64–0.79) vs. RR: 0.86 (95% CI: 0.81–0.90) with higher risk in the t130 mm Hg group. Stratified by class of medications: Few differences were observed in the association between BP-lowering treatment and outcomes for regimens based on different classes of medications, except HF, in which diuretics were associated with lower RR: 0.83 (95% CI: 0.72–0.95) than all other classes. This was driven largely by the results of ALLHAT. Cheng J, et al., 2014 (252) 24687000 Aim: To separately evaluate the effects of ACEIs and ARBs on all-cause mortality, CV deaths, and major CV events in pts with DM Study type: Meta-analysis of 35 high quality RCTs (1966– 2012) Size: 56,444 pts with DM; all trials had follow-up of at least 12 mo Inclusion criteria: RCTs including post hoc analyses and subgroups for DM with median follow-up of at least 12 mo. Comparisons with placebo, no treatment or other antihypertensive drugs, including ACEIs and ARBs. Exclusion criteria: Cross- over trials • ACEIs significantly reduced the risk of all- cause mortality by 13% (RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.78–0.98), CV deaths by 17% (RR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70–0.99), and major CV events by 14% (RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77–0.95), including MI by 21% (RR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.65–0.95) and HF by 19% (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71–0.93). Treatment with ARBs did not significantly affect all-cause mortality (RR: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.82–1.08), CV death rate (RR: 1.21 (95% CI: 0.81–1.80) and major CV events (RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.85–1.01) with the exception of HF (RR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.59–0.82). Summary: • RCTs comparing ACEs vs. active drugs/placebo/no treatment: 26 RCTs (12 active drugs, 11 placebo) • RCTs comparing ARBs vs. active drugs/placebo/no treatment: 13 RCTs (3 active drugs, 10 placebo) • This meta-analysis provides evidence that ACEIs reduce all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and major CV events in pts with DM, whereas ARBs had no benefits on these outcomes. Arguedas JA, et al., 2013 (244) 24170669 Aim: To determine if “lower” BP targets (any target <130/85 mm Hg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared to “standard” BP targets (<140–160/90–100 mm Hg) in pts with DM. Study type: Meta-analysis of RCTs. Inclusion criteria: RCTs in which individuals were randomized to a “lower” compared with a “standard” BP target. Exclusion criteria: Studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Excluded studies were UKPDS 1998, HTN in Diabetes Study IV 1q outcomes: Total mortality, total serious adverse events, MI, stroke, CHF, and ESRD. Results: Only 1 trial (ACCORD) compared outcomes associated with 'lower' (<120 mm Hg) or 'standard' (<140 mm Hg) SBP targets in 4734 pts. Despite achieving a significantly lower BP (119.3/64.4 mm Hg vs. 133.5/70.5 mm Hg, p<0.0001), and using more antihypertensive medications, the only significant benefit in the group assigned to 'lower' SBP was a reduction in the incidence Conclusions: Evidence from RCTs does not support BP targets lower than standard targets in pts with HTN and DM. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 187 Size: 5 RCTs recruiting a total of 7,314 ps.

The effect of SBP targets on mortality was compatible with both a reduction and increase in risk: RR: 1.05 (95% CI: 0.84–1.30), low- quality evidence. Trying to achieve the 'lower' SBP target was associated with a significant increase in the number of other serious adverse events: RR: 2.58 (95% CI: 1.70–3.91; p<0.00001), absolute risk increase 2.0%. 4 trials (ABCD-H, ABCD-N, ABCD-2V, and a subgroup of HOT) specifically compared clinical outcomes associated with 'lower' vs. 'standard' targets for DBP in pts with DM. The total number of pts included in the DBP target analysis was 2580. Pts assigned to 'lower' DBP had a significantly lower achieved BP: 128/76 mm Hg vs. 135/83 mm Hg, p<0.0001. There was a trend towards reduction in total mortality in the group assigned to the 'lower' DBP target: RR: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.53–1.01), mainly due to a trend to lower non- CV mortality. There was no difference in stroke: RR: 0.67 (95% CI: 0.42– 1.05), in MI: RR: 0.95 (95% CI: 0.64–1.40) or in CHF: RR: 1.06 (95% CI: 0.58–1.92), low quality evidence. End-stage renal failure and total serious adverse events were not reported in any of the trials. A sensitivity analysis of trials comparing DBP targets <80 mm Hg (as suggested in clinical guidelines) vs. <90 mm Hg showed similar results. There was a high risk of selection bias for every outcome analyzed in favor of the 'lower' target in the trials included for the analysis of DBP targets.

The annual 1° outcome 1.87% in the intensive therapy group and 2.09% in the standard therapy group HR: 0.88 (95% CI: 0.073–1.06; p=0.20). The annual rates of death from any cause were 1.28% and 1.19% in the 2 groups, respectively (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.39–0.89; p=0.01). Serious adverse events attributed to antihypertensive treatment occurred in 3.3% of the intensive therapy group and 1.3% of the standard therapy group (p<0.001). expected. Pts younger than 40 y or older than 79 y were not included. Summary: In pts with type 2 DM and high risk for CV events, targeting SBP of <120 as compared with <140 mm Hg did not reduce the rate of composite outcome of fatal and nonfatal major CV events and was associated with greater risk for adverse events.

Effect was modified by proteinuria (p=0.006) and markers of trial quality. Intensive BP lowering reduced the risk of kidney failure HR: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.62–0.86) but not in pts without proteinuria at baseline HR: 1.12 (95% CI: 0.67–1.87). No clear effect on CV events or death. Limitations: All trials used open label, in 2 pts were blinded, substantial variability in design quality. There was substantial variability in BP targets by MAP, SBP and DBP or only DBP.

A trial involving pediatric pts targeted a 24-h mean BP <the 50th percentile, compared with the 50th to 95th percentiles in the control group. 2 trials had more liberal targets for intensive treatment (<140–150 mm Hg SBP, 85 mm Hg DBP) difference in DBP seen between treatment arms. Overall, a more intensive regimen reduced risk of composite kidney failure events by 17% (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.98), reduced the risk of ESKD alone by 18% (pooled HR for composite outcomes: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.93). • Intensive BP lowering had no effect on kidney failure in pts who did not have proteinuria (3 trials involving 1,218 pts (HR: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.67–1.87), but it did reduce the risk of progressive kidney failure by 27% (5 trials involving 1,703 pts (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62–0.86) in pts who did have proteinuria at baseline. • CV outcomes: major CV events reported in 5 trials (472 CV events in 5,308 pts with CKD). Intensive BP lowering did not reduce risk of CV events in pts with CKD, but the CIs remained wide (RR: 1.09 (95% CI: 0.83, 1.42). 6 trials reported stroke outcomes (197 events in 5,411 pts), 5 trials reported MI (138 events in 4,317 pts), and 5 trials reported HF (118 events in 5,308 pts). They saw no clear effect of intensive treatment on any of these vascular outcomes. • Death: 10 trials involving 6,788 pts reported 846 deaths. There was no clear effect of intensive BP lowering on risk of all-cause death (RR: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.05) or CV death (RR: 1.20 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.75). 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 190 Data Supplement 48.

Conclusions: Pts treated with nicardipine are more likely to reach the physician-specified TR than those treated with labetalol. In this study (2014), initial SBP was not a predictor of the ability to achieve the pre-specified TR in 30 min. Subgroup analysis demonstrated the similar results for sub-populations with end-organ damage (n=141) and renal dysfunction (n=104).

Exclusion criteria: Traumatic brain injury; intracranial neoplasm, received antihypertensive medication within previous 24 h, brain stem herniation, immediate brain death, acute MI, or bradycardia 50 bpm. • 28 pts randomized to labetalol and 26 to nicardipine. Goal BP defined using the latest consensus recommendations. Results: All pts receiving nicardipine achieved BP goal Compared with 61% in the labetalol group (p<0.001). 89% of the nicardipine group achieved goal within 60 min vs. 25% in the labetalol group (p<0.001). The nicardipine group had better maintenance of BP, greater percent of time spent within goal and less BP variability compared with the labetalol group (p<0.001). Less rescue medication had to be given to the nicardipine than the labetalol group (p<0.001). Limitations: Very small; pseudo-randomization. Conclusions: In acutely hypertensive stroke pts, a superior BP-lowering response was achieved with nicardipine over labetalol. Despite this, there was no significant difference in clinical outcomes. CATIS He J, et al., 2014 (202) 24240777 Aim: Evaluate whether immediate BP reduction in pts with acute ischemic stroke would reduce death and major disability in 14 d or hospital discharge. Study type: RCT Size: 4,071 pts Inclusion criteria: Pts had nonthrombolysed ischemic stroke within 48 h of onset and elevated SBP.

The pts had onset of spontaneous ICH within 6 h of enrollment. 1q outcome: Death or major disability, defined as a score of 3-6 on the modified Rankin scale, at 90 d. Results: 719 of 1,382 pts receiving intensive treatment as compared to 785 of 1,412 pts receiving guideline- recommended treatment had a 1° outcome event [OR with intensive treatment: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.75–1.01; p=0.06). Ordinal analysis showed significantly lower modified Rankin scores with intensive treatment (OR for greater disability: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.77–1.00; p=0.04). Mortality was 11.9% in the group receiving intensive treatment and 12.0% in the group receiving guideline- recommended treatment. Nonfatal serious events were not significantly different between the groups. Limitations: No major limitations. Conclusions: In pts with ICH, intensive lowering of BP resulted in a borderline significant reduction in the rate of death or severe disability at 90 d. An ordinal analysis of modified Rankin scores indicated improved functional outcomes with intensive lowering of BP. Intensive BP reduction was shown to be safe and to result in significantly better health-related quality of life. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 207 PRONTO Peacock WF, et al., 2014 (286) 24655702 Study type: RCT Size: 104 pts • To determine the efficacy and safety of clevidipine vs. standard-of-care (SOC) iv antihypertensive therapy in hypertensive acute HF. • This was a randomized, open-label, active control study of clevidipine vs. standard-of-care in ED pts with acute HF with 6%3\u0003\u0014\u0019\u0013\u0003PP\u0003+J\u0011 1q outcome: Co-1° endpoints were median time to and % attaining a SBP within a prespecified TR at 30 min.

Farias S, et al., 2014 13849948 (287) Aim: To determine if achievement of target BP is less likely in pts with higher initial BP using a post hoc analysis in a pt subset from CLUE Study type: RCT Post-hoc Analysis Size: 223 pts Inclusion criteria: SBP t180 mm Hg on 2 consecutive occasions 10 min apart in the ED. Exclusion criteria: Contraindication to giving either a BB or CCB or clinical scenarios in which a compelling agent was indicated. • This was a post hoc analysis of CLUE, an RCT, in which pts were dichotomized using the median presenting SBP as the partition point. Individuals above and below the median were evaluated as to the proportion achieving the 1° outcome. 1° outcome: Achievement of target SBP range within 30 min. Results: Early achievement of target SBP was independent of presenting SBP. Limitations: 2º analysis of the 1° CLUE study; SBP control only evaluated for the first 30 min posttreatment; no inclusion of critically ill pts; 80% of enrolled subjects were African-American. Conclusions: Presenting SBP does not appear to affect the ultimate ability to reduce BP for pts with marked, acute HTN in the ED when treated with either IV nicardipine or IV labetalol.

Size: 38 studies testing 58 different interventions containing data on 15,519 pts; 9 studies assessed simplification of dosing regimen Inclusion criteria: • Database search for all RCTs, all languages, in Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL (all y through 2002) • Population of interest were pts with essential HTN in primary care, outpatient, or community setting • Interventions aimed to increase adherence to BP-lowering medication • Reported outcome was adherence 1q endpoints: Adherence as assessed by pill counts, self-report, or electronic monitoring system Results: • 9 studies assessed simplification of dosing regimen, 7 of which compared adherence associated with frequency of administration (twice daily vs. once daily [n=6] or 3 times daily vs. twice daily [n=1]). • All studies examining effect of dosing frequency demonstrated improved adherence (range: 8%, 19.6% improvement; p<0.01 for all). • Adherence to antihypertensive medication was significantly improved with once daily vs. multiple daily dosing regimens. Most studies used an electronic monitoring system. Limitations in the systematic review include heterogeneity in pts, interventions, and outcomes, and the majority of studies were of low quality. In addition, different definitions of adherence in the RCTs make it difficult to examine the precise relationship of adherence to BP control. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 215 • RCT where pt care in intervention group(s) compared to either no intervention or usual care • Only 1 of the 7 studies demonstrated improved BP control (change in SBP 6 mm Hg; p<0.01). However, different medications used for comparison (once daily amlodipine 5 mg vs. diltiazem SR 60 mg twice daily). Iskedjian M, et al., 2002 (308) 11911560 Study type: Meta-analysis Size: 8 studies involving a total of 11,485 observations (1,830 for once daily dosing, 4,405 for twice daily dosing, 4,147 for >twice daily dosing, 9,655 for maximum daily dose).

Claxton AJ, et al., 2001 (309) 11558866 Study type: Systematic review Size: 76 studies Inclusion criteria: • Database search of MEDLINE, Psychinfo, HealthStar, Health & Psychological Instruments, and Cochrane library 1986–2000 • Compliance rates assessed using electronic monitoring device • Data pooled to calculate mean compliance with once daily, twice daily, 3 times daily, and 4 times daily dosing regimens 1q endpoints: Mean compliance rates by prescribed dose regimen Results: • 26 studies evaluated CVD; 17 HTN only. • For all studies, mean dose-taking compliance defined as number of appropriate doses taken during each d was 79% for once daily, 69% for twice daily, 65% for 3 times daily and 51% for 4 WLPHV\u0003GDLO\\\u0003GRVLQJ\u0003 S\u0013\u0011\u0013\u0013\u0014\u0003IRU\u0003RQFH\u0003GDLO\\\u0003vs. 3 times daily, once daily vs. 4 times daily, and twice daily vs. 4 times daily; no statistically significant between once daily vs. twice daily or twice daily vs. 3 times daily dosing). • Medication compliance as measured by electronic monitoring devices were improved with less frequent dosing. Once-daily dosing was associated with the greatest rate of compliance. Limitations of this analysis include heterogeneity of studies and disease states studied. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 216 • For 14 studies that assessed ability to take doses within prescribed time frame, once daily regimens were associated with better dose-time compliance (74% ± 31%) compared to twice daily (58% ± 23%) or 3 times daily (46% ± 8%); formal statistical analysis not conducted due to too few studies. Sherrill B, et al., 2011 (310) 22142349 Study type: Meta-analysis to compare health resource use cost, adherence, and persistence between groups of pts taking antihypertensives as SPCs vs. free-equivalent components.

Costs were also significantly lower with SPC than with free-equivalent components. However, cost data should be interpreted with caution considering unadjusted costs were used in this meta-analysis. In addition, heterogeneity was present in analyses of each outcome. This meta-analysis did not include the observational study by Yang et al. as that study used an adjusted analysis methodology. Yang W, et al., 2010 (311) 20629600 Study type: Observational analysis using multivariate regression-adjusted analysis to compare compliance/persistence, health care resources, and cost associated with SPC or FC antihypertensives over 6 mo study period both nationally and at the state level.

Community health workers were broadly defined as health workers who were trained as part of an intervention, had no formal paraprofessional designation, and had relationship with the community being served. The community health workers, predominantly women, were recruited from the community, and resembled the pts in race/ethnicity and socioeconomic background. Roles included: (1) providing health education and information to pts and families; (2) ensuring that pts received services necessary for BP control; (3) providing direct services, including measuring and monitoring BP; (4) providing social support to the pts and their family members; and (5) serving as mediators between pts and the healthcare and social service systems. Comparator: Usual care or other comparison group 1q endpoint: Differences between groups in BP control groups favored community health worker groups over control and ranged from 4%– 46% over 6–24 mo, across 7 RCTs; though 1 RCT showed no difference between groups. Safety endpoint: N/A 2q endpoints: • Appointment keeping: significant improvements ranging from 19%–39% (relative changes) over 12–24 mo in community health worker intervention • Adherence to medications: Range of findings included significant improvement in community health worker intervention group compared with control, between-group differences ranged from 8%–14%; 26% greater compliance among pts receiving intense community health worker interventions; and 17% significant improvement in adherence to medication with counseling by community health workers. Limitations: High level of heterogeneity of the populations, settings, interventions, and outcomes Summary: Including community health workers as part of the HTN care team resulted in significant improvements BP control, appointment keeping, and adherence to antihypertensive medications, primarily among low income, urban African Americans. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 223 Carter BL, et al., 2009 (321) 19858431 Aim: Determine potency of interventions for BP involving nurses and pharmacists Study type: Meta- analysis Size: 37 RCTs of team- based HTN care involving nurse or pharmacist intervention Inclusion criteria: RCT of team-based HTN care involving nurse or pharmacist intervention Exclusion criteria: Absence of above Intervention: Team-based HTN care involving nurse or pharmacist intervention in nearly all studies involving nurses or pharmacists in clinics, consistent and dedicated case management activities were provided that were distinct from traditional nursing or pharmacist duties. However, pharmacists in community pharmacies usually had to incorporate the intervention with traditional medication dispensing functions. Comparator: Usual care 1q endpoint: OR (95% CI) for controlled BP were nurses: 1.69 (1.48, 1.93); pharmacists within primary care clinics: 2.17 (1.75, 2.68); and community pharmacists: 2.89 (1.83, 4.55). Mean (SD) reductions in SBP were: nurse intervention, 5.84 (8.05) mm Hg; pharmacists in clinics, 7.76 (7.81) mm Hg; and community pharmacists, 9.31 (5.00) mm Hg. There were no significant differences between nurse and pharmacist effects (p\u0013.19). 1q Safety endpoint: N/A • Stepwise regression was used to compare studies that included a given intervention strategy with studies that did not. Several individual components of the interventions were associated with significant reductions in mean SBP including pharmacist recommended medication to physician (-27.21 mm Hg; p=0.002), counseling about lifestyle modification (-12.63 mm Hg; p=0.03), pharmacist performed the intervention (- 11.70 mm Hg; p=0.03), use of a treatment algorithm (-8.46 mm Hg; p<0.001), completion of a drug profile and/or medication history (-8.28 mm Hg; p=0.001),and the overall intervention potency score assigned by the study reviewers (p<0.001). The factors associated with a reduction in DBP were: referral was made to a specialist (- 19.61 mm Hg; p=0.04), providing pt education about BP medications (-17.60 mm Hg; p=0.003), completion of a drug profile and/or medication history (-7.27 mm Hg; p=0.006), pharmacist performed the intervention (-4.03 mm Hg; p=0.04), or nurse performed the intervention (- 3.94 mm Hg; p=0.04).

Team members who collaborated with pts and PCPs were predominantly nurses (28 studies); pharmacists (15 studies); both nurses and pharmacists (5 studies); or community health workers, integrated care managers, or behavioral interventionists (4 studies). Key roles included HTN medication management, active pt follow-up, and adherence and self- management support. Interventions were usually 1q endpoint: • Proportion with controlled BP: Absolute percentage point (pct pt) change in pts with controlled BP from 33 studies comparing team- based care to usual care: median effect estimate was 12 pct pts (IQI=3.2–20.8 pct pts). Most individual effect estimates in the favorable direction were significant (p<0.05). • Reduction in SBP (44 studies): The median reduction in SBP was 5.4 mm Hg (IQI=2.0–7.2 mm Hg). Most individual effect estimates were significant (p<0.05). • Reduction in DBP: The overall median reduction in 2q endpoints: Compared with pts in usual care, the proportion of pts receiving team-based care with “high” medication adherence (defined as taking medications as prescribed >80% of the time) increased by a median of 16.3 pct pts (9 studies). Stratified analyses for BP outcomes: • Team member role in medication management: Larger improvements in BP outcomes than overall estimates were demonstrated when team members could make changes to medications independent of the PCP or team members could provide medication recommendations and make changes with the PCP’s approval as compared to team members providing only adherence support and information on medication and HTN. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 225 Exclusion criteria: Inclusion of populations with 2º HTN (e.g., pregnancy) or with a history of CVD (e.g., MI) implemented across multiple settings in the healthcare system and in the community, where they were implemented in pharmacies and through home outreach visits. Comparator: Usual care DBP was 1.8 mm Hg (IQI=0.7–3.2 mm Hg) from 38 studies. Safety endpoint: No harm to pts was identified from team- based care interventions in the included studies or the broader literature. •Number of team members added: Adding 2 members demonstrated larger improvements in the proportion of pts with controlled BP and reduction in DBP compared to adding only 1; median reductions in SBP were similar regardless of team size. • Improvement in the proportion of pts with controlled BP was similar for studies from both healthcare and community settings. Limitations: Included studies reported significant differences in pt demographics between intervention and comparison groups at baseline, possible contamination within intervention and comparison groups, and issues related to inadequate description of populations and implemented interventions. Summary: There is strong evidence that team- based care is effective in improving BP outcomes, especially when pharmacists and nurses are part of the team.

Quality reports were given quarterly to both the intervention and control groups. 6.1%, difference: 6.0% (95% CI: 2.2%, 9.7%), p=0.001 for interaction term), BP control (no comorbidities: 9.7% vs. 4.3%, difference: 5.5% (95% CI: 1.6%, 9.3%), p=0.01 for interaction term; with DM: 9.0% vs. 1.2%, difference: 7.8% (95% CI: 3.2%, 12.4%), p=0.007 for interaction term; with DM or ischemic vascular disease: 9.5% vs. 1.7%, difference: 7.8% (95% CI: 3.0%, 12.6%), p=0.01 for interaction term), and in smoking cessation interventions (12.4% vs. 7.7%, difference: 4.7% (95% CI: -0.3%, 9.6%), p=0.02 for interaction term). Intervention clinics performed better on all measures for Medicaid and uninsured pts except cholesterol control, but no differences were statistically significant. suggests that, for every 13 pts seeing incentivized clinicians, 1 more pt would achieve BP control. The 7.8% absolute change in BP control for pts with DM represents a 46% relative increase in BP control among intervention pts compared with the baseline of 16.8%. Further research is needed to determine whether this effect of the P4P intervention on BP control increases or decreases over time. However, this NNT to achieve BP control through incentives, taken together with the large relative increase in percentage of pts with BP control and the potential effect of BP control on risk of ischemic vascular events, suggests a reasonable opportunity to reduce morbidity and mortality through P4P as structured in this study. Limitations: Some clinics exited the program after randomization, with more control clinics leaving than intervention clinics. Additionally, this intervention occurred in the setting of a voluntary QI program.

Rakotz MK, et al., 2014 (330) 25024244 Aim: The goal of this study was to develop a technology-based strategy to identify pts with undiagnosed HTN in 23 primary care practices and integrate this innovation into a continuous QI initiative in a large, integrated health system. • Of the 139,666 active adult primary care pts in these 23 practices, 47,822 already had a diagnosis of HTN, white- coat HTN, pre-HTN, or elevated BP. The 3 screening algorithms for undiagnosed HTN were applied to the remaining pts’ EHRs. There were 1,586 pts who met the criteria of 1 or more of the algorithms and were therefore considered at risk for undiagnosed HTN. • In phase 1, we reviewed EHRs using algorithms designed to identify pts at risk for undiagnosed HTN. We then invited each at-risk pt to complete an automated office BP protocol. In phase 2, we instituted a QI process that included regular physician feedback and office- based computer alerts to evaluate at-risk pts not screened in phase 1. Study pts were observed for 24 additional mo to determine rates of diagnostic resolution. After phase 1, we established a continuous QI initiative to further evaluate pts who remained at risk for undiagnosed HTN. In this 24-mo follow-up phase (phase 2), all primary care physicians received monthly lists of their pts who continued to be at risk for undiagnosed HTN. • Of the 1,033 at-risk pts who remained active during phase 2, 740 (72%) were classified by the end of the follow-up period: 361 had HTN diagnosed, 290 had either white coat HTN, pre- HTN, or elevated BP diagnosed, and 89 had normal BP. By the end of the follow-up period, 293 pts (28%) had not been classified and remained at risk for undiagnosed HTN. • Although we used multiple algorithms to identify pts with elevated BP readings, it is unlikely that we identified all pts with undiagnosed HTN. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 231 These pts were contacted by staff via telephone or letter to arrange a follow-up appointment. These pts remained on the physicians’ lists until an automated office BP evaluation was completed or an ICD-9 diagnosis was entered into the chart that indicated the pt’s at-risk status had been resolved. In addition, when an at-risk pt arrived for an office visit for any reason, a best practice advisory was prominently displayed on that pt’s EHR screen to notify the medical assistant and physician that an automated office BP measurement was needed. Borden WB, et al., 2014 (331) 25447261 Aim: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the 2014 expert panel BP management recommendations on pts managed in U.S. ambulatory CV practices. • Using the National CV Data Registry PINNACLE Registry, we assessed the proportion of 1,185,253 pts who met the 2003 and 2014 panel recommendations, highlighting the populations of pts for whom the BP goals changed. N/A • Of 1,185,253 pts in the study cohort, 706,859 (59.6%) achieved the 2003 JNC-7 goals. Using the 2014 recommendations, 880,378 (74.3%) pts were at goal. Among the 173,519 (14.6%) for whom goal achievement changed, 40,323 (23.2%) had a prior stroke or TIA, and 112,174 (64.6%) had CAD. In addition, the average Framingham risk score in • Among U.S. ambulatory cardiology pts with HTN, nearly 1 in 7 who did not meet JNC-7 recommendations would now meet the 2014 treatment goals. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 232 this group was 8.5 ± 3.2%, and the 10-y atherosclerotic CVD risk score was 28.0 ± 19.5%.

Exclusion criteria: Absence of above. Intervention: Mobile technologies to reduce CVD risk behaviors– varied across studies Comparator: Varied across studies. 1q endpoint: Varied across studies. 1q Safety endpoint: N/A Summary: mHealth or mobile technologies have the potential to transform the delivery of health- related messages and ongoing interventions targeting behavior change. Moreover, the use of monitoring devices (e.g., Bluetooth- enabled BP monitors and blood glucose monitors) permits the sharing of important pt self-management parameters with healthcare providers in real time and the delivery of feedback and guidance to pts when they need it. Furthermore, using mHealth tools for monitoring provides the clinician data that far exceed what can be measured in the brief clinical encounter and reflect the status of physiological or behavioral measures in the person’s natural setting. Liu S, et al., 2013 (333) 23618507 Aim: Assess the efficacy of e- counselling in reducing BP Inclusion criteria: 1) Trials that investigated the effect of Internet-based lifestyle interventions on SBP and DBP, 2) trials that included Intervention: Internet- based intervention as preventive e-counselling or advice using Web sites or e-mails to modify exercise or diet as a 1q endpoint: MD in BP reduction (Internet- based – usual care): SBP: -3.8 mm Hg (95% CI: - 5.63– -2.06), I2=61 • Behavior change techniques that were used in more than 50% of the successful internet-based interventions included the following: providing information on consequences of behavior in general 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 233 Study type: Systematic review, meta-analysis Size: 13 RCTs or case- control studies supplemental components such as mobile text messages, telephone, or in-person support, 3) intervention duration of at least 8 wk, and 4) SBP and DBP reported as 1° or 2° outcome, measured at a clinic or office. Exclusion criteria: Absence of above. means of improving BP control. These Internet- based interventions were primarily self-guided, and access was gained via desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smart phone. The duration of each intervention had to be at least 8 wk in order to achieve clinically meaningful outcomes, including the pt’s ability to learn and adhere to complex new behaviors, and to allow for sufficient time to demonstrate a stable reduction in BP. The majority (9/13) of interventions had supplemental components that were not internet-based, such as text messages, in- person visits, and live support and 10/13 targeted both exercise and diet behaviors. Comparator: Usual care with no internet-based strategy. DBP: -2.1 mm Hg (95% CI: - 3.51– -0.65), I2=57 Influence of intervention attributes: Intervention duration: Long-term (6 mo) intervention: SBP -5.8 mm Hg (95% CI: -4.3– -4.1) Short-term (<6 mo) intervention: SBP -3.47 mm Hg (95% CI: -5.2– -1.7) DBP mean reduction: results not reported, not statistically significant. # of behavior change techniques: 5 behavior change techniques: SBP -5.92 mm Hg (95% CI: -7.43– -4.42) / DBP -2.45 mm Hg (95% CI: - 3.50– -1.41) <5 behavior change techniques: SBP -2.69 mm Hg (95% CI: -4.61– -0.78) / DBP -0.02 mm Hg (95% CI: - 1.20–1.17) 1q Safety endpoint: N/A (86%), incorporating feedback on performance (86%), prompting self- monitoring of behaviors (71%), and giving instructions on how to perform the targeted behavior change (71%). Summary: Internet-based interventions reduced SBP and DBP significantly compared to usual care. Internet-based interventions had greater effect on BP lowering if they were 1) long-term ( 6 mo) in duration, and 2) used >5 behavior change techniques. Omboni S, et al., 2013 (334) 23299557 Aim: Review data from RCTs on the effectiveness of HBPT vs. usual care with respect to improvement of BP control, healthcare resources utilization and costs, Inclusion criteria: • English language • Published up to Feb. 2012 • RCT testing HBPT vs. usual care. Intervention: HBPT had to be based on the use of an electronic automated BP monitor storing values obtained at the pt’s home and transferring them to a remote computer 1q endpoint: Compared to usual care, HBPT improved: • Office SBP by 4.71 mm Hg (95% CI: 6.18–3.24; p<0.001); I2=52.2%; p=0.003 • Office DBP by 2.45 mm Hg (95% CI: 3.33–1.57; p<0.001); I2=40.4%; p=0.048 Limitations: • HBPT intervention features (telemonitoring systems and self- monitoring programs) as well as inclusion criteria and demographic and clinical characteristics of the comparative groups varied across 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 234 pt’s quality of life and adverse events. Study type: Meta- analysis Size: 23 unique RCTs with 7037 pts (though not all studies reported on all outcomes of interest) Exclusion criteria: Absence of above through a telephone line (wired or wireless), a modem or an Internet connection. At least 1 self BP measurement had to be available for each pt in the intervention group. Comparator: Usual care • Office BP Control (<140/90 mm Hg nondiabetic pts and <130/80 mm Hg diabetic pts): RR: 1.16 (95% CI: 1.04–1.29; p<0.001); I2=69%; p<0.001 2q endpoint: Compared to usual care, HBPT improved: • Greater prescription of antihypertensive medications: weighted MD 0.40 (95% CI: 0.17–0.62; p<0.001); I2=84.2%; p<0.001 • Lower number of office visits: weighted MD -0.18 (95% CI: -0.37–0.00); I2=32.7%; p=0.146 • Quality of life physical component of SF-12 or SF-36 questionnaire: weighted MD 2.78 (95% CI: 1.15–4.41); I2=0.0%; p=0.853 • There was no difference between HBPT and usual care in: • Therapeutic adherence [92% HBPT vs. 90% usual care; between-group difference +1.30% (95% CI: - 2.31–4.90; p=0.481), I2=0.00%; p=0.888) • Quality of life mental component of SF-12 or SF-36 questionnaire: weighted MD - 0.11 (95% CI: -1.65–1.43); I2=0.0%; p=0.984 Cost: • Healthcare costs were significantly higher in the studies and contributed to the high heterogeneity of the studies • Most studies were powered to test differences in BP lowering, not 2º outcomes Summary: HBPT yielded greater SBP and DBP reductions and a larger proportion of pts achieving BP control than usual care. HBPT vs. usual care resulted in greater prescription of antihypertensive medications and fewer office visits but no difference in therapeutic adherence. Healthcare costs were higher with HBPT than usual care, but when HBPT-related costs were excluded, medical costs were similar between groups. Use of HBPT vs. usual care improved quality of life physical component but not mental. Authors note that the amount of office BP reduction attributable to HBPT was in line with that observed in RCTs of antihypertensive drugs compared with placebo. The estimate was also larger than that usually related to HBP self-monitoring, which speaks in favor of a possible added value of the teletransmission approach. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 235 HBPT group vs. usual care: weighted MD 662.92 (95% CI: 540.81–785.04) euros per pt; I2=99.6%; p<0.001, but costs were similar when only medical costs (excluding HBPT-related costs) were considered (-12.4; 95% CI: - 930.52–906.23) euros; p=0.767. Safety endpoint: No difference was observed in the risk of adverse events (RR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.86– 1.71; p=0.111) Verberk W, et al., 2011 (335) 21527847 Aim: Examine the usefulness of telecare for HTN management Study type: Meta- analysis Size: 9 RCTs with 2,501 pts Inclusion criteria: 1) Published in the English language, 2) pts were diagnosed as hypertensive and performed BP self- measurement at home, 3) RCTs that compared telecare of BP with usual care, 4) data were transmitted to healthcare providers by telephone, modem, Internet, or mail, and 5) either change in BP or the number of pts that reached their target BP was an outcome and was provided in the study. Date restrictions not reported. Exclusion criteria: Absence of above Intervention: Telecare for HTN management (treatment and/or coaching). Telecare involved a data transmission process to collect data on a pt’s health status to allow remote HTN management. Procedures varied in length and frequency of contact and method of delivery (i.e., often telephone or cell phone with or without internet/computer; with or without behavioral counseling by nurse or pharmacist), often as an adjunct to “usual care” clinical visits. Comparator: Usual care 1q endpoint: Difference in BP Reduction (Telecare-Usual care): • SBP 5.2 ± 1.5 mm Hg (95% CI: 2.31–8.07) • DBP 2.1 ± 0.8 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.52–3.69) Safety endpoint: N/A Limitations: Telecare intervention methods varied greatly across studies Summary: Telecare led to a greater decrease in SBP and DBP compared with usual care. Telecare seems a valuable tool to support HTN management. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 236 Agarwal R, et al., 2011 (27) 21115879 Aim: Quantify both the magnitude and mechanisms of benefit (including effect on therapeutic inertia) of home BP monitoring on BP reduction. Therapeutic inertia was defined as no change in medications combined with uncontrolled BP. Study type: Systematic review and meta-analysis Size: 37 RCTs with 9,446 pts. Trial settings included community (n=5), dialysis unit (n=2), general practices (n=18), hospitals and general practice (n=1), and hospital-based outpatient units (n=11). Inclusion criteria: Studies that randomized pts to control or home BP monitoring group Exclusion criteria: Absence of above Intervention: Home BP monitoring as an adjunct to usual care for HTN Comparator: Usual care with BP monitoring in clinic 1q endpoint: Compared with usual care alone, home- based BP monitoring: •Reduced SBP: -2.63 mm Hg (95% CI: -4.24 – -1.02) and • Reduced DBP: -1.68 mm Hg (95% CI: -2.58– -0.79) • Greater reduction in SBP by HBPM interventions was seen with added telemonitoring (effect size -3.20; 95% CI: - 4.66– -1.73) vs. home BP monitoring (effect size -1.26; 95% CI: -2.20– -0.31; p=0.029). This finding is relevant to telemonitoring 2q endpoints: • More frequent reductions in antihypertensive medication (presumably due to identification of white coat HTN): RR: 2.02 (95% CI: 1.32–3.11) • Lowered therapeutic inertia (i.e., unchanged medication despite elevated BP: RR for unchanged medication 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68–0.99) Limitations: Different inclusion and exclusion criteria, different BP measurement techniques, drug titration protocols, pt populations, and duration of follow-up across studies likely introduced significant heterogeneity in effect size. Summary: Home BP monitoring leads to a small but significant reduction in SBP and DBP. Greater reduction in SBP is seen when HBPM is accompanied by specific programs to titrate antihypertensive drugs. 1 such strategy is telemonitoring, in which BP readings obtained at home are relayed to the provider who can then take appropriate action, thus reducing therapeutic inertia.

Summary: QI strategies are associated with improved HTN control. QI strategies improved SBP and the proportion of pts achieving SBP control and had a more modest effect on DBP and the proportion of pts achieving DBP control. Team change (i.e., a focus on HTN by someone in addition to the pt’s physician) had the largest effect on both SBP and DBP. All of the strategies assessed may be beneficial in terms of clinically meaningful reductions in BP under some circumstances and in varying combinations. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 240 SBP/DBP, median reduction: 3.3 mm Hg (IQR: 2.6–10.1)/ 2.8 mm Hg (IQR: 0.4–6.7) SBP/DBP control: 13%/ 9% (IQR: 5.3–11.4) • Pt reminders SBP/DBP, median reduction: 3.3 mm Hg (IQR: 2.3–4.5)/ 0.4 mm Hg (IQR: -2.4–5.0) DBP control: 2% (IQR: 1.1– 9.4) • Team change SBP/DBP, median reduction: 9.7 mm Hg (IQR: 4.2–14.0) (p<0.05)/ 4.2 mm Hg (IQR: 0.2–6.8) (p<0.05) SBP/DBP control: 22% (IQR: 9.0–33.8)/ 17% (IQR: 5.7– 24.5) • Financial incentives SBP/DBP, median reduction: - 13.3 mm Hg/ 0.0 mm Hg (IQR: -2.0–2.5) DBP control: 4% (IQR: -1.1– 9.4) Safety endpoint: N/A Carter BL, et al., 2009 (321) 19858431 Aim: Determine potency of interventions for BP involving nurses and pharmacists Study type: Meta- analysis Size: 37 RCTs of team-based HTN care involving nurse or Inclusion criteria: RCT of team-based HTN care involving nurse or pharmacist intervention Exclusion criteria: Absence of above Intervention: Team- based HTN care involving nurse or pharmacist intervention In nearly all studies involving nurses or pharmacists in clinics, consistent and dedicated case management activities were provided that were distinct from traditional nursing or 1q endpoint: • OR (95% CI) for controlled BP were: nurses: 1.69 (1.48, 1.93); pharmacists within primary care clinics: 2.17 (1.75, 2.68); and community pharmacists: 2.89 (1.83, 4.55). • Mean (SD) reductions in SBP were: nurse intervention: 5.84 (8.05) mm Hg; pharmacists in clinics: 7.76(7.81) mm Hg; and • Stepwise regression was used to compare studies that included a given intervention strategy with studies that did not. Several individual components of the interventions were associated with significant reductions in mean SBP including pharmacist recommended medication to physician (-27.21 mm Hg; p=0.002), counseling about lifestyle modification (-12.63 mm Hg; p=0.03), pharmacist performed the intervention (-11.70 mm Hg; p=0.03), use of a treatment 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 241 pharmacist intervention pharmacist duties.

Agarwal R, et al., 2011 (27) 21115879 Aim: Quantify both the magnitude and mechanisms of benefit (including effect on therapeutic inertia) of home BP monitoring on BP reduction. Therapeutic inertia was defined as no change in medications combined with uncontrolled BP. Study type: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Inclusion criteria: Studies that randomized pts to control or home BP monitoring group Exclusion criteria: Absence of above Intervention: Home BP monitoring as an adjunct to usual care for HTN Comparator: Usual care with BP monitoring in clinic 1q endpoint: Compared with usual care alone, home-based BP monitoring: • Reduced SBP: -2.63 mm Hg (95% CI: -4.24– -1.02) and • Reduced DBP: -1.68 mm Hg (95% CI: -2.58– -0.79) • Greater reduction in SBP by home BP monitoring interventions was seen with added telemonitoring effect size: -3.20 (95% CI: -4.66– - 1.73) vs. home BP monitoring effect size: -1.26; 95% CI: - 2.20– -0.31; p=0.029. Safety endpoint: N/A 2q endpoints: • More frequent reductions in antihypertensive medication (presumably due to identification of white coat HTN): RR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.32–3.11 • Lowered therapeutic inertia (i.e., unchanged medication despite elevated BP: RR for unchanged medication 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68–0.99) Limitations: Different inclusion and exclusion criteria, different BP measurement techniques, drug titration protocols, pt populations, and duration of follow-up across studies likely introduced significant heterogeneity in effect size. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 242 Size: 37 RCTs with 9446 pts. Trial settings included community (n=5), dialysis unit (n=2), general practices (n=18), hospitals and general practice (n=1), and hospital-based outpatient units (n=11). Summary: • Home BP monitoring leads to small but significant reduction in SBP and DBP. Greater reduction in SBP is seen accompanied by specific programs to titrate antihypertensive drugs. One such strategy is telemonitoring, in which BP readings obtained at home are relayed to the provider who can then take appropriate action.

Key roles included HTN medication management, active pt follow-up, and adherence and self- management support. Interventions were usually implemented across multiple settings in the healthcare system and in the community, where they were implemented in pharmacies and through home outreach visits. Comparator: Usual care estimate was 12 pct pts (IQI=3.2–20.8 pct pts). Most individual effect estimates in the favorable direction were significant (p<0.05). • Reduction in SBP (44 studies): The median reduction in SBP was 5.4 mm Hg (IQI=2.0–7.2 mm Hg). Most individual effect estimates were significant (p<0.05). • Reduction in DBP: The overall median reduction in DBP was 1.8 mm Hg (IQI=0.7–3.2 mm Hg) from 38 studies. Safety endpoint: No harm to pts was identified from team- based care interventions in the included studies or the broader literature. Stratified analyses for BP outcomes: • Team member role in medication management: Larger improvements in BP outcomes than overall estimates were demonstrated when team members could make changes to medications independent of the PCP or team members could provide medication recommendations and make changes with the PCP’s approval as compared to team members providing only adherence support and information on medication and HTN. • Number of team members added: $GGLQJ\u0003\u0015\u0003PHPEHUV\u0003GHPRQVWUDWHG\u0003 larger improvements in the proportion of pts with controlled BP and reduction in DBP compared to adding only 1; median reductions in SBP were similar regardless of team size. • Improvement in the proportion of pts with controlled BP was similar for studies from both healthcare and community settings. Limitations: Included studies reported significant differences in pt demographics between intervention and comparison groups at baseline, possible contamination within intervention and comparison groups, and issues related to inadequate description of populations and implemented interventions.

Exclusion criteria: Did not reside in Durham County or had a neurocognitive disorder that prevented enrollment 1q endpoint: 1) Difference in SBP and DBP from enrollment (BP obtained in the clinic at enrollment) to the last BP as measured in clinic within 6 mo after enrollment, 2) proportion of pts that achieved BP <140/90 mm Hg by last clinic visit within 6 mo, and 3) proportion of pts with BP <140/90 mm Hg or drop in SBP 10 mm Hg by last visit relative to their enrollment BP. Results: • Mean change in BP: -4.7 mm Hg (SD ± 21.4) / -2.8 mm Hg (SD ± 11.8) after 6 mo • BP control (<140/90 mm Hg) rate: Increased from 51% at baseline to 63% at 6 mo • Proportion with BP<140/90 or 10 mm Hg decrease in SBP at 6 mo was 69% • Among those who were in tiers 1 (BP=140/90– 159/99 mm Hg) and 2 (BP159/99 mm Hg) at enrollment (n=889), BP change was -8.8 mm Hg (SD ± 15.8) / -5.0 mm Hg (SD ± 10.0) and -23.7 mm Hg (SD ± 26.5) / -10.1 mm Hg (SD ± 14.1), respectively. Summary: A multicomponent- tiered HTN program that included team-based care with PAs and community health coaches was associated with improved BP control in a diverse community- based population. Though the web-based approach presented technical challenges for some pts, there was a direct association between higher use of Heart360 and larger recorded BP declines as entered into Heart360. This provides some indirect evidence that those pts who were more engaged with their BP self-monitoring achieved better BP control.

Karunaratne K, et al., 2013 (343) 23658247 Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of renal indicators outlined in P4P on the management of HTN in primary care. To estimate the cost implications of the resulting changes in prescribing patterns of antihypertensive medication following introduction of such indicators. Study type: Prospective cohort study using a large primary care database. Inclusion criteria: A total of 10,040 pts had confirmed stage 3–5 CKD in the 2 y pre-QOF and formed the study cohort. Exclusion criteria: None Intervention: The implementation of national estimated GFR reporting and the inclusion of renal- specific indicators in a primary care P4P system since April 2006 has promoted identification and better management of risk factors related to CKD. In the UK, the P4P framework is known as the QOF. Comparator: N/A • Mean age of the cohort at the start of the study period was 64.8 y, 55% were female. In those pts with stage 3–5 CKD 83.9% were hypertensive, defined by a pre-P4P BP of >140/85 or currently taking antihypertensive medication. The proportion of pts with CKD 3–5 attaining the BP target of 145/80 increased from 41.5% in the pre-QOF period to 50.0% in the post-QOF period. This increase was even more marked for those with HTN in the pre- QOF period (28.8%–45.1%). In the hypertensive pts, mean BP fell from 146/79 mm Hg to 140/76 in the first 2 y post-P4P [p<0.01, analysis of variance]. Summary: Population BP control has improved since the introduction of P4P renal indicators, and this improvement has been sustained. This was associated with a significant increase in the use of antihypertensive medication, resulting in increased prescription cost. Longer-term follow-up will establish whether or not this translates to improved outcomes in terms of progression of CKD, CVD and pt mortality. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 247 This cohort was taken from a database collated as part of a clinical decision support system used to assist the management of CKD in primary care. Size: 90,250 pts on general practitioner registers with a valid serum creatinine estimation in the 6-y study period. A total of 10 040 pts had confirmed stage 3–5 CKD in the 2 y pre- QOF and formed the study cohort. BP reduction was sustained in the last 2 y of the study, 139/75 (p<0.01, analysis of variance). The proportion of hypertensive pts taking ACEIs or angiotensin blockers increased, this was also sustained in the third time period. An increase in the prescribing of diuretics, CCBs and BBs was also observed. The additional cost of increased prescribing was calculated to be euro 25.00 per hypertensive pt based on GP prescription data.

Summary: Good quality of care for HTN was stable or improving before P4P was introduced. P4P had no discernible effects on processes of care or on HTN related clinical outcomes. Generous financial incentives, as designed in the UK P4P policy, may not be sufficient to improve quality of care and outcomes for HTN and other common chronic conditions. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 248 Size: 470,725 pts with HTN diagnosed between Jan 2000– Aug 2007. Bardach NS, et al., 2013 (327) 24026600 Aim: To assess the effect of P4P incentives on quality in EHR-enabled small practices in the context of an established QI initiative. Study Type & Size: A cluster-randomized trial of small (<10 clinicians) primary care clinics in New York City from April 2009–March 2010. • Participating clinics (n=42 for each group) had similar baseline characteristics, with a mean of 4,592 (median, 2,500) pts at the intervention group clinics and 3,042 (median, 2,000) at the control group clinics. • A city program provided all participating clinics with the same EHR software with decision support and pt registry functionalities and QI specialists offering technical assistance. • Incentivized clinics were paid for each pt whose care met the performance criteria, but they received higher payments for pts with comorbidities, who had Medicaid insurance, or who were uninsured (maximum payments: $200/pt; 100,000/clinic). Quality reports were given quarterly to both the intervention and control groups. • Intervention clinics had greater adjusted absolute improvement in rates of appropriate antithrombotic prescription 12.0% vs. 6.1%, difference: 6.0% (95% CI: 2.2%–9.7%; p=0.001 for interaction term), BP control (no comorbidities): 9.7% vs. 4.3%, difference: 5.5% (95% CI: 1.6%–9.3%; p=0.01 for interaction term); with DM: 9.0% vs. 1.2%, difference: 7.8% (95% CI: 3.2%–12.4%; p=0.007 for interaction term); with DM or ischemic vascular disease: 9.5% vs. 1.7%, difference: 7.8% (95% CI: 3.0%–2.6%; p=0.01 for interaction term), and in smoking cessation interventions (12.4% vs. 7.7%), difference: \u0017\u0011\u001a\b\u0003 \u0018\b\u0003&, \u0003í\u0013\u0011\u0016\b–9.6%; p=0.02 for interaction term). Intervention clinics performed better on all measures for Medicaid and uninsured pts except cholesterol control, but no differences were statistically significant. Summary: In our study, although the effect of the intervention was lower than the 10% improvement that we estimated a priori, the absolute risk reduction for BP control among pts with DM was 7.8% (NNT, 13). This suggests that, for every 13 pts seeing incentivized clinicians, 1 more pt would achieve BP control. The 7.8% absolute change in BP control for pts with DM represents a 46% relative increase in BP control among intervention pts compared with the baseline of 16.8%. Further research is needed to determine whether this effect of the P4P intervention on BP control increases or decreases over time. However, this NNT to achieve BP control through incentives, taken together with the large relative increase in percentage of pts with BP control and the potential effect of BP control on risk of ischemic vascular events, suggests a reasonable opportunity to reduce morbidity and mortality through P4P as structured in this study. Limitations: Some clinics exited the program after randomization, with more control clinics leaving than intervention clinics. Additionally, this intervention occurred in the setting of a voluntary QI program. This may reflect a high level of intrinsic 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 249 motivation to improve among practices in the study, as demonstrated by engagement with the QI specialists Maimaris W, et al., 2013 (345) 23935461 Aim: To assess strategies for influencing HTN care including procurement of essential medications, the existence of simple national guidelines for HTN management, introduction of financial incentives for health care practitioners to diagnose or treat HTN, and enhanced health insurance coverage. Study type: Systematic review examining the effect of national or regional health system arrangements on HTN care and control Study selection criteria based on: 1) HTN awareness. Defined as pts with clinically measured hypertensives who have been diagnosed by a health care professional as hypertensive. 2) HTN treatment. Defined as the use of at least 1 antihypertensive medication in a pt with known HTN. 3) Antihypertensive medication adherence. Defined as consistently taking the antihypertensive medication regimen as prescribed by the health care provider. 4) HTN control: defined as the achievement of BP<140/90 mm Hg (or other explicitly defined threshold) in individuals being treated for HTN, or, alternatively, measured by the mean BP amongst individuals with HTN. • The screening process is described using an adapted PRISMA flowchart. 5,514 articles were screened by title and abstract for inclusion. The full text of 122 of the 5,514 articles was obtained and assessed for eligibility. 53 studies met eligibility criteria for this review. 51 of the included studies were quantitative and 2 were qualitative. Of the 51 quantitative studies, 1 was an RCT; 12 were cohort studies, 2 of which were retrospective; 3 were case-control studies; 32 were cross-sectional studies; and 3 were ecological studies. 42 of the 53 studies (79%) were carried out in countries classified by the World Bank as high- income countries, 36 of which were in the U.S. 6 studies were carried out in upper middle-income countries, 3 in lower middle-income • Health insurance status: 15 cross-sectional studies reported comparisons of HTN outcomes in insured and uninsured pts. 8 of these 15 studies reported that insurance was associated with improved HTN treatment, control or medication adherence. The 7 other cross- sectional studies that compared HTN outcomes in insured pts and uninsured pts, reported no significant negative or positive associations between insurance status and HTN outcome. • Medication costs or medication co-payments: All 6 of these studies reported significant associations between reduced co-payments or costs and improved HTN control or medication adherence. • Co-payments for medical care: 14 quantitative studies measured the association of medication co-payments or costs with HTN control or treatment adherence, 9 of which were set in the U.S., and 1 in each of Cameroon, China, Finland, Israel, and Brazil. 2 of the 14 studies had a low risk of bias. 7 of the 14 studies were cohort studies, 1 was a case- control study, and 6 were cross- sectional studies. All 7 cohort • Although lacking longitudinal studies, we found a large positive association between having a routine physician or place of care for HTN management and treatment, awareness, control, and adherence to antihypertensive treatment, again in the U.S. publication and reporting bias noted by authors. 2017 Hypertension Guideline Data Supplements © 2017 American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association, Inc. 250 countries, and 1 in a low-income country. studies reported associations between increased medication costs or co-payments and reductions in HTN control or reduced adherence to antihypertensive medication, although for 1 of these 7 cohort studies, the association between increased copayments and reduced medication adherence was only found for low medication co-payments, and at high co-payment levels medication adherence was actually found to increase (OR for medication adherence vs. baseline of 1 for $0 co- payments was 0.72 for $1–$9 co-payments (p=0.05), 1.02 for $10–$29 co-payments (p=0.05), and 1.32 for co-payments . $30 (p=0.05) • Physician remuneration models: 2 studies evaluated the association of physician remuneration models with HTN control or treatment adherence, 1 an ecological study set in Canada, and 1 a U.S. cross- sectional study. Neither study had a low risk of bias. The U.S. study reported improved rates of HTN control amongst pts treated under a capitation model compared to fee-for service pts (adjusted OR for HTN control: 1.82 (95% CI: 1.02–3.27) for capitation vs. fee-for-service pts).

{"id": "20240704_6d6ee6f8-9650-ff4f-e053-2991aa0acf19.pdf", "text": "METFORMIN- metformin er 500 mg tablet, extended release Granules Pharmaceuticals Inc. ---------- Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets 500 mg and 750 mg DESCRIPTION Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP are oral antihyperglycemic drugs used in the management of type 2 diabetes. Metformin hydrochloride, USP (N,N- dimethyl-monohydrochloride,Imidodicarbonimidic diamide) is not chemically or pharmacologically related to any other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. The structural formula is as shown: Metformin hydrochloride, USP is a white or almost white, crystalline powder with a molecular formula of C4H11N5•HCl and a molecular weight of 165.62. Metformin hydrochloride is freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in alcohol, practically insoluble in acetone and in Methylene chloride. The pKa of metformin is 12.4. The pH of a 1% aqueous solution of metformin hydrochloride is 6.35. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP contain 500 mg or 750 mg of metformin hydrochloride as the active ingredient. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP 500 mg and 750 mg tablets contain the inactive ingredients hypromellose, magnesium stearate, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. Dissolution Method: Test 10 System Components and Performance - Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP comprises a dual hydrophilic polymer matrix system. Metformin hydrochloride, USP is combined with a drug release controlling polymer to form an \"inner\" phase, which is then incorporated as discrete particles into an \"external\" phase of a second polymer. After administration, fluid from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract enters the tablet, causing the polymers to hydrate and swell. Drug is released slowly from the dosage form by a process of diffusion through the gel matrix that is essentially independent of pH. The hydrated polymer system is not rigid and is expected to be broken up by normal peristalsis in the GI tract. The biologically inert components of the tablet may occasionally remain intact during GI transit and will be eliminated in the feces as a soft, hydrated mass. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its pharmacologic mechanisms of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects (except in special circumstances, see PRECAUTIONS ) and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease. Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Bioavailability Following a single oral dose of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, C is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours.Peak plasma levels are approximately 20% lower compared to the same dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, however, the extent of absorption (as measured by AUC) is similar to metformin hydrochloride tablets. At steady state, the AUC and C are less than dose proportional for metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets within the range of 500 to 2000 mg administered once daily. Peak plasma levels are approximately 0.6, 1.1, 1.4, and 1.8 mcg/mL for 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg once-daily doses, respectively. The extent of metformin absorption (as measured by AUC) from metformin hydrochloride extended- release tablets at a 2000 mg once-daily dose is similar to the same total daily dose administered as metformin hydrochloride tablets 1000 mg twice daily. After repeated administration of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, metformin did not accumulate in plasma. Within-subject variability in C and AUC of metformin from metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is comparable to that with metformin hydrochloride tablets. max max max Although the extent of metformin absorption (as measured by AUC) from the metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets increased by approximately 50% when given with food, there was no effect of food on C and T of metformin. Both high and low fat meals had the same effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride 850 mg averaged 654 ± 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin hydrochloride tablets, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally <1 mcg/mL. During controlled clinical trials of metformin hydrochloride tablets, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 mcg/mL, even at maximum doses. Metabolism and Elimination Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Renal clearance (see Table 1 ) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Specific Population Patients with Type 2 Diabetes In the presence of normal renal function, there are no differences between single- or multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of metformin between patients with type 2 diabetes and normal subjects (see Table 1) nor is there any accumulation of metformin in either group at usual clinical doses. The pharmacokinetics of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes is comparable to those in healthy normal adults. Renal Impairment In patients with decreased renal function (based on measured creatinine clearance), the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased in proportion to the decrease in creatinine clearance (see Table 1: also see also see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Impairment No parmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS ). Geriatrics max max Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin hydrochloride tablets in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and Cmax is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function (see Table 1; also see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).

Race No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. Clinical Studies Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets A 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of metformin hydrochloride extended- release tablets, taken once daily with the evening meal, was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes who had failed to achieve glycemic control with diet and exercise (HbA1c 7 to 10%, FPG 126 to 270 mg/dL). Patients entering the study had a mean baseline HbA1c of 8% and a mean baseline FPG of 176 mg/dL. After 12 weeks treatment, mean HbA had increased from baseline by 0.1% and mean FPG decreased from baseline by 2 mg/dL in the placebo group, compared with a decrease in mean HbA of 0.6% and a decrease in mean FPG of 23 mg/dL in patients treated with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1000 mg once daily. Subsequently, the treatment dose was increased to 1500 mg once daily if HbA was ≥7% but <8% (patients with HbA ≥8% were discontinued from the study). At the final visit (24- week), mean HbA had increased 0.2% from baseline in placebo patients and decreased 0.6% with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. A 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, taken once daily with the evening meal or twice daily with meals, was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes who had failed to cr cr cr 2 1c 1c 1c 1c 1c achieve glycemic control with diet and exercise (HbA 7 to 11%, FPG 126 to 280 mg/dL).

CONTRAINDICATIONS Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP are contraindicated in patients with: 1. Severe Renal Impairment (eGFR below 30mL/min/1.73m2) (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). 2.Known hypersensitivity to metformin hydrochloride, USP. 3.Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. Diabetic ketoacidosis should be treated with insulin. WARNINGS LACTIC ACIDOSIS: Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels(>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidenceof ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL (see PRECAUTIONS ). Risk factors for metformin associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concamitent use of certain drugs (e.g carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , CONTRAINDICATIONS , AND PRECAUTIONS ). If metformin associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended (see PRECAUTIONS ). PRECAUTIONS General Precautions • Lactic acidosis –There have been post marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of or metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: • Renal impairment —The post marketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient’s renal function include (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ): o Before initiating metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) o Metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). o Initiation of metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2. o Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. o In patients taking metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. • Drug Interactions – The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. • Age 65 or greater —The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient’s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. • Radiologic studies with contrast —Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets if renal function is stable. • Surgery and other procedures —withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. • Hypoxic states — several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets. • Excessive alcohol intake —Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients, therefore, should be warned against excessive alcohol intake, acute or chronic, while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. • Hepatic impairment —Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Vitamin B12 levels— In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed (see P R ECAUTIONS : Laboratory Tests ). Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12 measurements at 2- to 3- year intervals may be useful. Change in clinical status of patients with previously controlled type 2 diabetes— A patient with type 2 diabetes previously well controlled on metformin hydrochloride extended- release tablets who develops laboratory abnormalities or clinical illness (especially vague and poorly defined illness) should be evaluated promptly for evidence of ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis. Evaluation should include serum electrolytes and ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate, pyruvate, and metformin levels. If acidosis of either form occurs, metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets must be stopped immediately and other appropriate corrective measures initiated (see also WARNINGS ). Hypogly c emia — Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose- lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Macrovascular Outcomes —There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended- release tablets or any other anti-diabetic drug. Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the potential risks and benefits of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and of alternative modes of therapy. They should also be informed about the importance of adherence to dietary instructions, of a regular exercise program, and of regular testing of blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, renal function, and hematologic parameters. The risks of lactic acidosis, its symptoms, and conditions that predispose to its development, as noted in the WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS sections, should be explained to patients. Patients should be advised to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately and to promptly notify their health practitioner if unexplained hyperventilation, myalgia, malaise, unusual somnolence, or other nonspecific symptoms occur. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of metformin therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. Patients should be counselled against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets alone does not usually cause hypoglycemia, although it may occur when metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is used in conjunction with oral sulfonylureas and insulin. When initiating combination therapy, the risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be explained to patients and responsible family members. (See Patient Information printed below.) Patients should be informed that metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets must be swallowed whole and not crushed or chewed, and that the inactive ingredients may occasionally be eliminated in the feces as a soft mass that may resemble the original tablet. Laboratory Tests Response to all diabetic therapies should be monitored by periodic measurements of fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, with a goal of decreasing these levels toward the normal range. During initial dose titration, fasting glucose can be used to determine the therapeutic response. Thereafter, both glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin should be monitored. Measurements of glycosylated hemoglobin may be especially useful for evaluating long-term control (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Initial and periodic monitoring of hematologic parameters (e.g., hemoglobin/hematocrit and red blood cell indices) and renal function (serum creatinine) should be performed, at least on an annual basis.While megaloblastic anemia has rarely been seen with metformin hydrochloride therapy, if this is suspected, vitamin B12 deficiency should be excluded. Instruct patients to inform their doctor that they are taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets prior to any surgical or radiological procedure, as temporary discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be required until renal function has been confirmed to be normal (see PRECAUTIONS ). Drug Interactions (Clinical Evaluation of Drug Interactions Conducted with Metformin hydrochloride) Glyburide —In a single-dose interaction study in type 2 diabetes patients, coadministration of metformin and glyburide did not result in any changes in either metformin pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Decreases in glyburide AUC and C were observed, but were highly variable. The single-dose nature of this study and the lack of correlation between glyburide blood levels and pharmacodynamic effects, makes the clinical significance of this interaction uncertain (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Concomitant metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients ). Furosemide —A single-dose, metformin-furosemide drug interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated that pharmacokinetic parameters of both compounds were affected by coadministration. Furosemide increased the metformin plasma and blood C by 22% and blood AUC by 15%, without any significant change in metformin renal clearance. When administered with metformin, the Cmax and AUC of furosemide were 31% and 12% smaller, respectively, than when administered alone, and the terminal half- max max life was decreased by 32%, without any significant change in furosemide renal clearance. No information is available about the interaction of metformin and furosemide when coadministered chronically. Nifedipine —A single-dose, metformin-nifedipine drug interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin C and AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount excreted in the urine. T and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Metformin had minimal effects on nifedipine. Drugs that reduce metformin clearance—Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2 [OCT2] / multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use. Such interaction between metformin and oral cimetidine has been observed in normal healthy volunteers in both single- and multiple- dose, metformin-cimetidine drug interaction studies, with a 60% increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and a 40% increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC. There was no change in elimination half-life in the single- dose study. Metformin had no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics. Although such interactions remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system. Other —Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving metformin hydrochloride extended- release tablets, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors —Topiramate or other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) frequently cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with metformin hydrochloride extended- release tablets may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients. Alcohol —Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human daily max max dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test (S. typhimurium), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative. Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B Recent information strongly suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities. Most experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly needed. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Metformin was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of about 2 and 6 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin. Nursing Mothers Studies in lactating rats show that metformin is excreted into milk and reaches levels comparable to those in plasma. Similar studies have not been conducted in nursing mothers. Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. If metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is discontinued, and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Controlled clinical studies of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) ADVERSE REACTIONS In A US double blind clinical study of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablets therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo. Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of the metformin hydrochloride tablets patients, and that were more common in metformin hydrochloride tablets than placebo treated patients, are listed in Table 6. Table 6: Most Common Adverse Reactions (>5 Percent) in a Placebo- Controlled Clinical Study of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets Monotherapy* Adverse Reaction Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets (n=141) Placebo (n=145) % of Patients Diarrhea 53.2 11.7 Nausea/Vomiting 25.5 8.3 Flatulence 12.1 5.5 Asthenia 9.2 5.5 Indigestion 7.1 4.1 Abdominal Discomfort 6.4 4.8 Headache 5.7 4.8 *Reactions that were more common in metformin hydrochloride tablets than placebo treated patients. Diarrhea led to discontinuation of study medication in 6% of patients treated with metformin hydrochloride tablets. Additionally, the following adverse reactions were reported in ≥1 - ≤5% of metformin hydrochloride tablets patients and myalgia, lightheaded, dyspnea, nail disorder, rash, sweating increased, taste disorder, chest discomfort, chills, flu syndrome, flushing, and palpitation. In worldwide clinical trials over 900 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in placebo and active controlled studies. In placebo controlled trails, 781 patients were administered metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 195 patients received placebo. Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of the metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets patients, and that were more common in metformin hydrochloride extended- release tablets than placebo treated patients are listed in Table 7. Table 7: Most Common Adverse Reactions (>5 Percent) in Placebo- Controlled Studies of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets* Metformin Hydrochloride Extended- Release Tablets(N=781) Placebo (N=195) Adverse Reactions % of patients Diarrhea 9.6 2.6 Nausea/Vomiting 6.5 1.5 Diarrhea led to discontinuation of study medication in 0.6% of patients treated with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Additionally, the following adverse reactions were reported in ≥1 - ≤5% of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets patients and were more commonly reported with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets than placebo: abdominal pain, constipation, distention abdomen, dyspepsia/heartburn, flatulence, dizziness, headache, upper respiratory infection, taste disturbance.*Reactions that were more common in metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets than placebo treated patients. OVERDOSAGE Overdose of metformin hydrochloride has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin hydrochloride has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases (see WARNINGS ). Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected. DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP or any other pharmacologic agent. Dosage of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily doses. The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP in adults is 2000 mg. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP should generally be given once daily with the evening meal. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient. During treatment initiation and dose titration (see Recommended Dosing Schedule), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP either when used as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin. Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. Short-term administration of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well- controlled on diet alone. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed. Occasionally, the inactive ingredients of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP will be eliminated in the feces as a soft, hydrated mass. (See Patient Information printed below.) Recommended Dosing Schedule Adults In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day. However, a lower recommended starting dose and gradually increased dosage is advised to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms. The usual starting dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP is 500 mg once daily with the evening meal. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly, up to a maximum of 2000 mg once daily with the evening meal. If glycemic control is not achieved on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP 2000 mg once daily, a trial of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP 1000 mg twice daily should be considered. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Clinical Studies .) In a randomized trial, patients currently treated with metformin hydrochloride tablets were switched to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Results of this trial suggest that patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets treatment may be safely switched to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily at the same total daily dose, up to 2000 mg once daily. Following a switch from metformin hydrochloride tablets to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, glycemic control should be closely monitored and dosage adjustments made accordingly (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Clinical Studies ). Pediatrics Safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP in pediatric patients have not been established. Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and periodically thereafter. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2. Initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with an eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2 is not recommended. In patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy. Discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if the patients eGFR later falls below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2 (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures Discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable. Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients If patients have not responded to 4 weeks of the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets monotherapy, consideration should be given to gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea while continuing metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP at the maximum dose, even if prior primary or secondary failure to a sulfonylurea has occurred. Clinical and pharmacokinetic drug- drug interaction data are currently available only for metformin plus glyburide (glibenclamide). With concomitant metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and sulfonylurea therapy, the desired control of blood glucose may be obtained by adjusting the dose of each drug. In a clinical trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and prior failure on glyburide, patients started on metformin hydrochloride tablets 500 mg and glyburide 20 mg were titrated to 1000/20 mg, 1500/20 mg, 2000/20 mg or 2500/20 mg of metformin hydrochloride tablets and glyburide, respectively, to reach the goal of glycemic control as measured by FPG, HbA1c and plasma glucose response (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Clinical Studies ). However, attempts should be made to identify the minimum effective dose of each drug to achieve this goal. With concomitant metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP and sulfonylurea therapy, the risk of hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylurea therapy continues and may be increased. Appropriate precautions should be taken. (See Package Insert of the respective sulfonylurea.) If patients have not satisfactorily responded to 1 to 3 months of concomitant therapy with the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tabletsand the maximum dose of an oral sulfonylurea, consider therapeutic alternatives including switching to insulin with or without metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets and Insulin Therapy in Adult Patients The current insulin dose should be continued upon initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy should be initiated at 500 mg once daily in patients on insulin therapy. For patients not responding adequately, the dose of metformin hydrochloride extended- release tablets should be increased by 500 mg after approximately 1 week and by 500 mg every week thereafter until adequate glycemic control is achieved. The maximum recommended daily dose is 2000 mg for metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. It is recommended that the insulin dose be decreased by 10% to 25% when fasting plasma glucose concentrations decrease to less than 120 mg/dL in patients receiving concomitant insulin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP. Further adjustment should be individualized based on glucose-lowering response. Specific Patient Populations Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended for use in pregnancy. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP is not recommended in pediatric patients (below the age of 17 years). The initial and maintenance dosing of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment should be based on a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride extended- release tablets. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly. (See WARNINGS .) SPL PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT Patient Information Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP Read this information carefully before you start taking this medicine and each time you refill your prescription. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of your doctor’s advice. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand some of this information or if you want to know more about this medicine. What are Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets? Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets are used to treat type 2 diabetes. This is also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. People with type 2 This is also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. People with type 2 diabetes are not able to make enough insulin or respond normally to the insulin their bodies make. When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems including kidney damage, amputations, and blindness. Diabetes is also closely linked to heart disease. The main goal of treating diabetes is to lower your blood sugar to a normal level. High blood sugar can be lowered by diet and exercise, by a number of medicines taken by mouth, and by insulin shots. Before you take metformin hydrochloride extended- release tablets, try to control your diabetes by exercise and weight loss. While you take your diabetes medicine, continue to exercise and follow the diet advised for your diabetes. No matter what your recommended diabetes management plan is, studies have shown that maintaining good blood sugar control can prevent or delay complications of diabetes, such as blindness. Metformin hydrochloride and Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets have the same active ingredient. However, metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets works longer in your body. Both of these medicines help control your blood sugar in a number of ways. These include helping your body respond better to the insulin it makes naturally, decreasing the amount of sugar your liver makes, and decreasing the amount of sugar your intestines absorb. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets do not cause your body to make more insulin. Because of this, when taken alone, they rarely cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and usually do not cause weight gain. However, when they are taken with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, hypoglycemia is more likely to occur, as is weight gain. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may not be right for you. Talk with your doctor about your choices. You should also discuss your choices with your doctor if you are nursing a child. Can Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets be used in children? Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets has not been studied in children. How should I take Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets? Your doctor will tell you how much medicine to take and when to take it. You will probably start out with a low dose of the medicine. Your doctor may slowly increase your dose until your blood sugar is better controlled. You should take metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with meals. Your doctor may have you take other medicines along with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets to control your blood sugar. These medicines may include insulin shots. Taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with insulin may help you better control your blood sugar while reducing the insulin dose. Continue your exercise and diet program and test your blood sugar regularly while taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Your doctor will monitor your diabetes and may perform blood tests on you from time to time to make sure your kidneys and your liver are functioning normally. There is no evidence that metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets causes harm to the liver or kidneys. Tell your doctor if you: • have an illness that causes severe vomiting, diarrhea or fever, or if you drink a much lower amount of liquid than normal. These conditions can lead to severe dehydration (loss of water in your body). You may need to stop taking metformin hydrochloride extended- release tablets for a short time. • plan to have surgery or an x-ray procedure with injection of dye (contrast agent). You may need to stop taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets for a short time. • start to take other medicines or change how you take a medicine. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets can affect how well other drugs work, and some drugs can affect how well metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets work. Some medicines may cause high blood sugar. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed . Occasionally, the inactive ingredients of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be eliminated as a soft mass in your stool that may look like the original tablet; this is not harmful and will not affect the way metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets works to control your diabetes. What should I avoid while taking Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets? Do not drink a lot of alcoholic drinks while taking metformin hydrochloride extended- release tablets. This means you should not binge drink for short periods, and you should not drink a lot of alcohol on a regular basis. Alcohol can increase the chance of getting lactic acidosis. What are the side effects of Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets? • Lactic acidosis. Metformin, the active ingredient in metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, can cause a rare but serious condition called lactic acidosis (a buildup of an acid in the blood) that can cause death. Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in the hospital. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms, which could be signs of lactic acidosis: • you feel cold in your hands or feet • you feel dizzy or lightheaded • you have a slow or irregular heartbeat • you feel very weak or tired • you have unusual (not normal) muscle pain • you have trouble breathing • you feel sleepy or drowsy • you have stomach pains, nausea or vomiting Most people who have had lactic acidosis with metformin have other things that, combined with the metformin, led to the lactic acidosis. Tell your doctor if you have any of the following, because you have a higher chance for getting lactic acidosis with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if you: • have severe kidney problems, or your kidneys are affected by certain x-ray tests that use injectable dye • have liver problems • drink alcohol very often, or drink a lot of alcohol in short-term \"binge\" drinking • get dehydrated (lose a large amount of body fluids). This can happen if you are sick with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. Dehydration can also happen when you sweat a lot with activity or exercise and do not drink enough fluids • have surgery • have a heart attack, severe infection, or stroke The best way to keep from having a problem with lactic acidosis from metformin is to tell your doctor if you have any of the problems in the list above. Your doctor may decide to stop your metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets for a while if you have any of these things. Other Side Effects . Common side effects of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets include diarrhea, nausea, and upset stomach. These side effects generally go away after you take the medicine for a while. Taking your medicine with meals can help reduce these side effects. Tell your doctor if the side effects bother you a lot, last for more than a few weeks, come back after they’ve gone away, or start later in therapy. You may need a lower dose or need to stop taking the medicine for a short period or for good. About 3 out of every 100 people who take metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets have an unpleasant metallic taste when they start taking the medicine. It lasts for a short time. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets rarely cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) by themselves. However, hypoglycemia can happen if you do not eat enough, if you drink alcohol or if you take other medicines to lower blood sugar. General advice about prescription medicines If you have questions or problems, talk with your doctor or other healthcare provider. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for the information about metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets that is written for healthcare professionals. Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a patient information leaflet. Do not use metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not share your medicine with other people.

ABSTRACT AIM This clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain provides recommendations and algorithms for clinicians to assess and diagnose chest pain in adult patients. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was conducted from November 11, 2017, to May 1, 2020, encompassing randomized and nonrandomized trials, observational studies, registries, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports, and other relevant databases. Additional relevant studies, published through April 2021, were also considered. STRUCTURE Chest pain is a frequent cause for emergency department visits in the United States. The“2021 AHA/ACC/ASE/CHEST/ SAEM/SCCT/SCMR Guideline for the Evaluation and Diagnosis of Chest Pain” provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence on the assessment and evaluation of chest pain. This guideline presents an evidence-based approach to risk stratiﬁcation and the diagnostic workup for the evaluation of chest pain. Cost-value considerations in diagnostic testing have been incorporated, and shared decision-making with patients is recommended.

Chest Pain Means More Than Pain in the Chest.Pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. 2. High-Sensitivity Troponins Preferred. High- sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred stan- dard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. 3. Early Care for Acute Symptoms. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9-1-1. Although most patients will not have a cardiac cause, the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identi ﬁcation or exclusion of life-threatening causes. 4. Share the Decision-Making. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. 5. Testing Not Needed Routinely for Low-Risk Patients. For patients with acute or stable chest pain deter- mined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. 6. Pathways. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. 7. Accompanying Symptoms. Chest pain is the dominant a n dm o s tf r e q u e n ts y m p t o mf o rb o t hm e na n dw o m e n ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome. Women may be more likely to present with accom- panying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. 8. Identify Patients Most Likely to BeneﬁtF r o mF u r t h e r Testing. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre- test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will bene ﬁt the most from cardiac im- aging and testing. 9. Noncardiac Is In. Atypical Is Out. “Noncardiac ” should be used if heart disease is not suspected. “Atypical ” is a misleading descriptor of chest pain, and its use is discouraged. 10. Structured Risk Assessment Should Be Used. For pa- tients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evid ence-based diagnostic protocols. Figure 1 illustrates the take-home messages. PREAMBLE Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated scien- tiﬁc evidence into clinical prac tice guidelines with rec- ommendations to improve cardiovascular health. These guidelines, which are based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a foundation for the delivery of quality cardiovascular care. The ACC and AHA sponsor the development and publication of clinical practice guidelines without commercial support, and members volunteer their time to the writing and review efforts. Guidelines are ofﬁcial policy of the ACC and AHA. For some guidelines, the ACC and AHA partner with other organizations. Intended Use Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing car- diovascular disease. The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but these guidelines are relevant to patients throughout the world. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients’ in- terests. Guidelines are intended to de ﬁne practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, cir- cumstances and should not replace clinical judgment. Clinical Implementation Management, in accordance with guideline recommen- dations, is effective only when followed by both prac- titioners and patients. Adherence to recommendations can be enhanced by shared decision-making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities. Methodology and Modernization The ACC/AHA Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines (Joint Committee) continuously reviews, up- dates, and modiﬁes guideline methodology on the basis of published standards from organizations, including the Institute of Medicine ( 1,2), and on the basis of internal reevaluation. Similarly, pr esentation and delivery of guidelines are reevaluated and modi ﬁed in response to evolving technologies and o ther factors to optimally facilitate dissemination of information to healthcare professionals at the point of care. Gulati et al. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 2021 Chest Pain Guideline NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 e190 Numerous modi ﬁcations to the guidelines have been implemented to make them shorter and enhance “user friendliness. ” Guidelines are written and pre- sented in a modular, “knowledge chunk ” format, in which each chunk includes a table of recommenda- tions, a brief synopsis, recommendation-speci ﬁcs u p - portive text and, when appropriate, ﬂow diagrams or additional tables. Hyperlinked references are provided for each modular knowledge chunk to facilitate quick access and review. In recognition of the importance of cost–value consid- erations, in certain guidelines, when appropriate and feasible, an analysis of value for a drug, device, or inter- vention may be performed in accordance with the ACC/ AHA methodology (3). To ensure that guideline recommendations remain current, new data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the writing committee and staff. Going forward, targeted sections/knowledge chunks will be revised dynamically after publication and timely peer review of potentially practice-changing science. The previous designations of “full revision ” and “focused update ” will be phased out. For additional information and policies on guideline development, readers may consult the ACC/AHA guide- line methodology manual (4) and other methodology ar- ticles (5-7). The Class of Recommendation (COR) indicates the strength of recommendation, encompassing the esti- mated magnitude and certainty of beneﬁt in proportion to risk. The Level of Evidence (LOE) rates the quality of scienti ﬁc evidence supporting the intervention on the FIGURE 1 Take-Home Messages for the Evaluation and Diagnosis of Chest Pain JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al.

Selection of Writing Committee Members The Joint Committee strives to ensure that the guideline writing committee contains requisite content expertise and is representative of the broader cardiovascular com- munity by selection of experts across a spectrum of backgrounds, representing different geographic regions, sexes, races, ethnicities, intellectual perspectives/biases, and clinical practice settings. Organizations and profes- sional societies with related interests and expertise are invited to participate as partners or collaborators. Relationships With Industry and Other Entities The ACC and AHA have rigorous policies and methods to ensure that documents are developed without bias or improper inﬂuence. The complete policy on relationships with industry and other entities (RWI) can be foundonline. Appendix 1 of the guideline lists writing committee mem- bers’ relevant RWI; for the purposes of full transparency, their comprehensive disclosure information is available in the Supplemental Appendix . Comprehensive disclosure information for the Joint Committee is also available online. Evidence Review and Evidence Review Committees In developing recommendati ons, the writing committee uses evidence-based methodologies that are based on all available data ( 4,5). Literature searches focus on ran- domized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include regis- tries, nonrandomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinions. Only key references are cited. An independent evidence review committee is commissioned when there are $1 questions deemed of utmost clinical importance and merit formal systematic review to determine which patients are most likely to beneﬁt from a drug, device, or treatment strategy, and to what degree. Criteria for commissioning an evidence re- view committee and formal systematic review include absence of a current authoritative systematic review, feasibility of deﬁning the beneﬁt and risk in a time frame consistent with the writing of a guideline, relevance to a substantial number of patients, and likelihood that the ﬁndings can be translated into actionable recommenda- tions. Evidence review committee members may include methodologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and bio- statisticians. Recommendations developed by the writing committee on the basis of the systematic review are marked “ SR.” Guideline-Directed Management and Therapy The term guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) encompasses clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, and both pharmacological and procedural treatments. For these and all recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader should conﬁr md o s a g ew i t hp r o d u c ti n s e r tm a t e - rial and evaluate for contrain dications and interactions. Recommendations are limited to drugs, devices, and treatments approved for clinical use in the United States. Patrick T. O’Gara, MD, MACC, FAHA Chair, ACC/AHA Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Methodology and Evidence Review The recommendations listed in this guideline are, when- ever possible, evidence based. An initial extensive evi- dence review, which included literature derived from research involving human subjects, published in English, and indexed in MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline, was conducted from November 11, 2017, to May 1, 2020. Key search words included but were not limited to the following: acute coronary syndrome, angina, angina pectoris, aortic valve stenosis, biomarker, biomarkers, brain natriuretic peptide, cardiac-gated single photon emission computer-assisted tomography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance, chest pain, CKMB, coronary angiography, coro- nary arteriosclerosis, coronary artery disease, creatine kinase, creatine kinase MB, echocardiography, electrocar- diography, heart valve diseas e, hypertrophic cardiomyop- athy, magnetic resonance imaging, mitral valve stenosis, multidetector computed tomog raphy, myocardial infarc- t i o n ,m y o c a r d i a li s c h e m i a ,m y o c a r d i u m ,N T - p r o B N P , perfusion imaging, positron-emission tomography, pulmo- nary hypertension, stable angina, troponin I, troponin T, unstable angina, x-ray computed tomography . Additional relevant studies, published through November 2020 dur- ing the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables when appropriate. The ﬁnal evidence tables are included in the Online Data Supplement and summarize the evi- dence used by the writing committee to formulate rec- ommendations. References selected and published in the present document are representative and not all- inclusive. 1.2. Organization of the Writing Committee The writing committee consisted of cardiac intensivists, cardiac interventionalists, cardiac surgeons, cardiologists, emergency physicians, epidemiologists, and a lay/patient representative.

This guideline will not provide recommenda- tions on whether revascularization is appropriate or what modality is indicated. Such recommendations can be found in the forthcoming ACC/AHA coronary artery revascularization guideline.

Scope of the Problem Synopsis After injuries, chest pain is the second most common reason for adults to present to the emergency department (ED) in the United States and accounts for >6.5 million visits, which is 4.7% of all ED visits (1). Chest pain also leads to nearly 4 million outpatient visits annually in the United States ( 2). Chest pain remains a diagnostic chal- lenge in the ED and outpatient setting and requires thorough clinical evaluation. Although the cause of chest pain is often noncardiac, co ronary artery disease (CAD) affects >18.2 million adults in the United States and remains the leading cause of death for men and women, accounting for >365,000 deaths annually ( 3). Dis- tinguishing between seriou s and benign causes of chest pain is imperative. The lifetime prevalence of chest pain in the United States is 20% to 40% ( 4), and women experience this symptom more often than men (5). Of all ED patients with chest pain, only 5.1% will have an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and more than half will ulti- mately be found to have a noncardiac cause ( 6). None- theless, chest pain is the most common symptom of CAD i nb o t hm e na n dw o m e n . 1.4.2. Deﬁning Chest Pain Recommendations for De ﬁning Chest Pain Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 1 and 2. COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. An initial assessment of chest pain is recommended to triage patients effectively on the basis of the likelihood that symptoms may be attributable to myocardial ischemia (1-7). 1 C-LD 2. Chest pain should not be described as atypical, because it is not helpful in determining the cause and can be misinterpreted as benign in nature. Instead, chest pain should be described as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac becaus e these terms are more speciﬁc to the potential underlying diagnosis. Synopsis Chest pain is one of the most common reasons that people seek medical care. The term“chest pain” is used by patients and applied by clinicians to describe the many unpleasant or uncomfortable sensations in the anterior chest that prompt concern for a cardiac problem. Chest pain should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms. Chest pain should be considered stable when symptoms are chroni c and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Although the term chest pain is used in clinical practice, patients often report pressure, tightness, squeezing, heaviness, or burning. In this regard, a more appropriate term is “chest discomfort, ” because patients may not use the descriptor “pain. ” They may also report a location other than the chest, including the shoulder, arm, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw. Despite individual vari- ability, the discomfort induced by myocardial ischemia is often characteristic and therefore central to the diagnosis. For this reason, features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac. Although other nonclassic symptoms of ischemia, such as shortness of breath, nausea, radiating discomfort, or numbness, may be present, chest pain or chest discomfort remains the predominant symptom reported in men and women who are ultimately diagnosed with myocardial ischemia ( 3-7). Pain— described as sharp, ﬂeeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia. Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. Like most visceral discomfort, the sensation produced by myocardial ischemia is characteristically deep, difﬁcult to localize, and usually diffuse. Point tender- ness renders ischemia less likely. Reported symptoms lie somewhere on a continuum of higher or lower probability of ischemia based on the presence or absence of speci ﬁcc h a r a c t e r i s t i c s(Figure 2 ). Other clinical elements (e.g., duration, provoking and relieving factors, patient ag e, cardiac risk factors) pro- vide further focus toward or away from ischemia in the diagnostic process. It is essential to ascertain the char- acteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation ( 1-7). Ap a t i e n t’s history is the most important basis for considering presence or absence of myocardial ischemia, but the source of car- diac symptoms is complex, a nd their expression is variable. The diagnosis of ischemia may require data JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al. NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 2021 Chest Pain Guideline e195 beyond history alone. In some patients, what appears to be noncardiac chest pain may be ischemic in origin. 2. Chest pain has been traditionally strati ﬁed into “typical ” and “atypical ” t y p e s .C h e s tp a i nt h a ti sm o r e likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. The more classic the chest discomfort is based on quality, loca- tion, radiation, and provoking and relieving factors, the more likely it is to be of cardiac ischemic origin. Atyp- ical chest pain is a problematic term. Although it was intended to indicate angina without typical chest symptoms, it is more often used to state that the symptom is noncardiac in origin. As such, we discourage the use of atypical chest pain. Emphasis is more constructively placed on speci ﬁca s p e c t so f symptoms that suggest their or i g i ni nt e r m so fp r o b a b l e ischemia. Of note, chest pain is broadly deﬁned to also include referred pain in theshoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen. To diminish ambiguity, use “car- diac, ”“ possible cardiac, ” and “noncardiac ” to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged. 1.5.

History Synopsis Chest pain or chest pain equivalent will be referred to in these guidelines as“chest pain.” Patients presenting to the ED with nontraumatic chest pain are a frequent diagnostic challenge ( 1). The priorities are: 1) rapid initi- ation of optimal management in patients with life- threatening conditions such as ACS, aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as nonvascular s y n d r o m e s( e . g . ,e s o p h a g e a lr u p t u r e ,t e n s i o np n e u m o - thorax); and 2) deliberate therapy for those with less critical illness. Although there are several life-threatening causes, chest pain usually reﬂects a more benign condi- tion (Figure 3)( 2-4). The initial ECG is important to the evaluation, but history, examination, biomarkers, and other aids remain essential. There is frequently a lack of correlation between intensity of symptoms and seriousness of disease and general similarity of symptoms among different causes of chest pain. A comprehensive history that captures all the characteristics of chest pain (Table 3), including but not limited to its: 1) nature; 2) onset and duration; 3) location and radiation; 4) precipi- tating factors; 5) relieving factors; and 6) associated symptoms can help better identify potential cardiac cau- ses and should be obtained from all patients. Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. Angina pectoris is perceived as a retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress (physical or emotional) or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation (e.g., left Recommendation for History COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 C-LD 1. In patients with chest pain, a focused history that includes characteristics and duration of symptoms relative to presentation as well as associated features, and cardiovascular risk factor assessment should be obtained. FIGURE 3 Top 10 Causes of Chest Pain in the ED Based on Age (Weighted Percentage) Created using data from Hsia RY, et al. (3). ED indicates emergency department.

When actively treated or spontaneously resolving, it dissipates over a few minutes. Relief with nitroglycerin is not neces- sarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic crite rion, especially because other entities demonstrate comparable response (e.g., esophageal spasm) (1,5). Associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness, confusion, presyncope or syncope, or vague abdominal symptoms are more frequent among patients with diabetes, w omen, and the elderly. A detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, re- view of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms. 2.1.1. A Focus on the Uniqueness of Chest Pain in Women TABLE 3 Chest Pain Characteristics and Corresponding Causes Nature Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (e.g., pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing) (Section 1.4.2, Deﬁning Chest Pain). Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease (e.g., these symptoms usually occur with acute pericarditis). Onset and duration Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain (with radiation to the upper or lower back) is unlikely to be anginal and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Fleeting chest pain— of few seconds’duration— is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Location and radiation Pain that can be localized to a very limited area and pain radiating to below the umbilicus or hip are unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Severity Ripping chest pain (“worse chest pain of my life”), especially when sudden in onset and occurring in a hypertensive patient, or with a known bicuspid aortic valve or aortic dilation, is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome (e.g., aortic dissection). Precipitating factors Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS. Positional chest pain is usually nonischemic (e.g., musculoskeletal). Relieving factors Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Associated symptoms Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include, but are not limited to, dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting. Symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing, sharp pain, or discomfort in the throat or abdomen may occur in patients with diabetes, women,and elderly patients. ACS indicates acute coronary syndrome. Recommendations for a Focus on the Uniqueness of Chest Pain in Women Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 3 and 4. COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. Women who present with chest pain are at risk for underdiagnosis, and potential cardiac causes should always be considered (1-7). 1 B-NR 2. In women presenting with chest pain, it is recommended to obtain a history that emphasizes accompa- nying symptoms that are more common in women with ACS (1-7). Gulati et al. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 2021 Chest Pain Guideline NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 e198 Synopsis Most patients who present to the ED with chest pain are women, particularly among those $65 years of age (8). The ISCHEMIA (Internatio nal Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Ap- proaches) trial demonstrated that women with moderate- to-severe ischemia are more symptomatic than men ( 9). Women are less likely to have timely and appropriate care (10). This could be explained by the fact that women are more likely to experience prodromal symptoms when they seek medical care (11). Women may also present with accompanying symptoms (e.g., nausea, fatigue, and shortness of breath) more often than men (12-14 ). How- ever, chest pain remains the predominant symptom reported by women among those ultimately diagnosed with ACS, occurring with a frequency equal to men (3,5-7,15,16). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Traditional risk score tools and physician assessments often underestimate risk in women and misclassify them as having nonischemic chest pain ( 1,2). The PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) trial looked at sex differences in the presentation, risk factors, demographics, noninvasive test referrals, and results of 10,003 stable outpatients with suspected CAD (1). Women commonly presented with chest pain symptoms similar to men but also had a greater prevalence of other symptoms such as palpitations, jaw and neck pain, as well as back pain. Women also had more cardio vascular risk factors, including hypertension (66.6% versus 63.2%; p<0.001), hyperlipidemia (68.9% versus 66.3%; p ¼0.004), older age (62.4/C6 7.9 years of age versus 59.0/C6 8.4 years of age, p<0.001), cerebral or peripheral artery disease (6.2% versus 4.7%; p <0.001), family history of premature CAD (34.6% versus 29.3%; p <0.001), and sedentary lifestyle (53.5% versus 43.4%; p <0.001). Physician as- sessments often misclassify chest pain as nonanginal. The BARI 2D (Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes) trial reported that women with diabetes had a higher prevalence of angina than their male counterparts, with a lower functional ca- pacity and a lower incidence of obstructive CAD (16). 2. In the VIRGO (Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients) study, men and women #55 years of age were equally likely to present with chest pain (deﬁned as pain, pressure, tightness, discomfort; 89.5% versus 87 %, respectively). Women were more likely to report $3 associated symptoms than men (e.g., epigastric symptoms, palpitations, and pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, arms, or between the shoulder blades; 61.9% of women versus 54.8% of men; p<0.001) (3). Similar results were found in the YOUNG-MI (Myocardial Inf arction) registry where young men and women (#50 years of age) were equally likely to present with chest pain, although women were more likely to also have other associated symptoms ( 7). The HERMES (Highly Effective Reperfusion Evaluated in Multiple Endovascular Stroke) study used car- diolinguistic machine learning to record patient- reported symptoms and, in those diagnosed with obstructive CAD, there was no sex difference in the occurrence of chest pain ( 6). In a prospective trial of 1941 patients (39% women) with suspected ACS examining the diagnostic value of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (cTn), chest pain was reported in 92% of women and 91% of men ( 5). Additionally, women with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were more likely to present with “typical ” symptoms than men (77% versus 59%; p¼0.007). 2.1.2. Considerations for Older Patients With Chest Pain Recommendation for Considerations for Older Patients With Chest Pain COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 C-LD 1. In patients with chest pain who are>75 years of age, ACS should be considered when accompanying symptoms such as shortness of breath, syncope, or acute delirium are present, or when an unexplained fall has occurred (1). Synopsis Increased age is a signi ﬁcant risk factor for ACS. However, it is also a risk factor for comorbidities that are associated with alternative diagnoses associated with chest pain. As a resul t, a more extensive diag- nostic workup is required in older patients. Although patients >7 5y e a r so fa g ea c c o u n tf o r3 3 %o fa l lc a s e s of ACS, alternative diagnoses are still more common than a cardiac cause of chest pain at presentation ( 2,3). A substudy of the PROMISE trial has shown that pa- tients >75 years of age, with stable symptoms sug- gestive of CAD, are more likely to have a positive noninvasive test and more coronary artery calci ﬁcation than younger people. For these older patients, when compared with anatomic noninvasive testing for obstructive CAD with cardiac CT, a positive stress test JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al. NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 2021 Chest Pain Guideline e199 result was associated with i ncreased risk of cardio- vascular death or MI ( 4). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Patients >75 years of age may have symptoms of shortness of breath, syncope, mental impairment, or abdominal pain, or experienced an unexplained fall. The physician should have a heightened awareness to understand that these symptoms may be associated with ACS, in addition to chest pain (1). 2.1.3. Considerations for Diverse Patient Populations With Chest Pain Recommendations for Considerations for Diverse Patient Populations With Chest Pain COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 C-LD 1. Cultural competency training is recommended to help achieve the best outcomes in patients of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds who present with chest pain. 1 C-LD 2. Among patients of diverse race and ethnicity presenting with chest pain in whom English may not be their primary language, addressing language barrier s with the use of formal translation services is recommended. Synopsis There are marked racial and ethnic disparities when tri- aging patients who present for the evaluation of chest pain. Despite a greater number of Black patients presenting with angina pectoris relative to other races, this population is less likely to be treated urgently and less likely to have an ECG performed, samples for cardiac biomarkers drawn, cardiac monitoring performed, or pulse oximetry measured (1-4). Similar treatment disparities are found with Hispanic p a t i e n t sa n dt h o s ew h oa r ec o v e r e db yM e d i c a i do ra r e uninsured. Derived from a nationally representative sam- ple from the National Hospital Ambulatory Health Care Survey reﬂecting an estimated 78 million ED visits in the United States over a 10-year period, these ﬁndings have been unchanged over time (5). Such disparity in the man- agement of chest pain among diverse population subgroups contributes to worse outcomes, including the greater inci- dence of AMI and fatal coronary events seen in these key population subgroups (6,7). There are also disparities in the management of patients of South Asian descent who pre- sent with ACS, with the diagnosis often missed or delayed, resulting in poor outcomes (8-11). Consideration of race and ethnicity in the evaluation of patients with suspected ACS and in the outpatient evaluation of symptomatic patients is paramount to improving outcomes. Cultural competency training of providers is recommended to address health disparities in the evaluation and management of diverse patient population subgroups with chest pain. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In patients of various diverse groups presenting with chest pain, cultural competency training of providers to address racial and ethnic disparities may help to improve diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. Attention to race, ethnicity, and sociocultural differences should be considered in the evaluation and management of such patients. Cultural com petency training can help address dif ﬁculties in the assessment of patients because there may be differences in the description and perception of chest pain among various diverse patient groups. Such training may also help to minimize po- tential unconscious biases on the part of providers. Disparities in the management of chest pain among diverse populations cont ribute to worse outcomes, including the greater incidence of MI and fatal coronary events (1). 2. In patients of various racial and ethnic subgroups presenting with suspected ACS in whom English may not be their primary language, adequately addressing language barriers with the use of language translation i sv i t a lt oo b t a i na na c c u r a t ea n dc o m p l e t eh i s t o r y . Formal translation services such as those provided through institutions and virtual translation are recommended. 2.1.4. Patient-Centric Considerations Recommendation for Patient-Centric Considerations COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 C-LD 1. In patients with acute chest pain, it is recommended that 9-1-1 be activated by patients or bystanders to initiate transport to the closest ED by emergency medical services (EMS) (1). Gulati et al. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 2021 Chest Pain Guideline NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 e200 Synopsis Although chest pain remains one of the most common reasons that patients seek evaluation, among both sexes, there is a tendency for some patients to minimize perceived risk for cardiac disease, resulting in potentially avoidable delays in care ( 1). To alleviate this problem, e f f o r t ss h o u l db em a d et oe d u c a t ea l lp e o p l er e g a r d i n g their risk for a cardiac event and educate patients about the need for timely care if a heart attack is suspected. Education is essential regarding the need to call 9-1-1, provide transportation by EMS to the nearest ED, initiate early assessment and management of suspected ACS, including transmittal of prehospital ECGs ( 2), and inter- vene if complications occur en route to the ED (3). The ACC’s Early Heart Attack Care guide is a resource to help educate the public about early recognition of potential cardiac symptoms and the importance of activating 9-1-1 for transportation (4,5). Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. To ensure the timely delivery of appropriate care, especially reperfusion the rapy, it is strongly recom- mended that patients with acute chest pain be trans- ported to the ED by trained EMS personnel (2,3). EMS transportation is associated with substantial reductions in ischemic time and treatment delays. Moreover, 1 in 300 patients with chest pain transported to the ED by private vehicle suffers a cardiac arrest en route ( 3). Understanding the mode of transportation to the ED for patients with chest pain and educating those who arrive by private vehicle on the associated dangers is an important aspect of management. 2.2. Physical Examination Recommendation for Physical Examination COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 C-EO 1. In patients presenting with chest pain, a focused cardiovascular examination should be performed initially to aid in the diagnosis of ACS or other potentially serious causes of chest pain (e.g., aortic dissection, PE, or esophageal rupture) and to identify complications. Synopsis Life-threatening causes of chest pain include, but are n o tl i m i t e dt o ,A C S ,P E ,a o r t i cd i s s e c t i o n ,a n de s o p h a g e a l rupture. Because ST-segment –elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) can be recognized on the ECG, the major challenge is to distinguish between non –ST- segment –elevation (NSTE)-ACS and noncardiac chest pain (1). With an uncomplicated AMI, the examination may be negative. Sudden onset of severe chest pain or back pain associated with limb pulse differential suggest aortic dissection ( 2), but sensitivity of the latter ﬁnding alone was only 30% (3). PE may result in tachycardia, dyspnea, and accentuated P2. Noncoronary causes of chest pain include aortic stenosis, aort ic regurgitation, and hyper- trophic cardiomyopathy, which produces characteristic murmurs and pulse alterations. Chest pain of pericarditis increases in the supine position and may be associated with a friction rub. Stress cardiomyopathy presents in a similar manner as ACS. Chest pain accompanied by a painful, tympanic abdomen may indicate a potentially life-threatening gastrointestinal etiology such as esopha- geal rupture (4). Pneumonia may cause localized pleuritic chest pain accompanied by a friction rub. Pneumothorax may be accompanied by pleuritic chest pain and unilateral absence of breath sounds. Tenderness to palpation of the costochondral joints may indicate a musculoskeletal cause. Herpes zoster produces a painful rash in a derma- tomal distribution. Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. Although the causes of chest pain are numerous, the initial evaluation should focus on those that are life- threatening, such as ACS, PE, aortic dissection, and esophageal rupture, to fac ilitate rapid implementation of appropriate treatment ( 1). Speci ﬁcc l u e sc a nb e helpful (Table 4). Chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration markedly reduce the probability of ACS (1,5,6). Integrating the examination with other elements of the evaluation is crucial to establishing the correct diagnosis. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al.

Diagnostic Testing 2.3.1. Setting Considerations Recommendations for Setting Considerations Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 5 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. Unless a noncardiac cause is evident, an ECGshould be performed for patients seen in the ofﬁce setting with stable chest pain; if an ECG is unavailable the patient should be referred to the ED so one can be obtained (1-5). 1 C-LD 2. Patients with clinical evidence of ACS or other life-threatening causes of acute chest pain seen in the ofﬁce setting should be transported urgently to the ED, ideally by EMS (1-9). 1 C-LD 3. In all patients who present with acute chest pain regardless of the setting, an ECG should be acquired and reviewed for STEMI within 10 minutes of arrival (1-3,6,7,10). 1 C-LD 4. In all patients presenting to the ED with acute chest pain and suspected ACS, cTn should be measured as soon as possible after presentation (8,9). 3: Harm C-LD 5. For patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS initially evaluated in the ofﬁce setting, delayed transfer to the ED for cTn or other diagnostic testing should be avoided. Gulati et al. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 2021 Chest Pain Guideline NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 e202 Synopsis The goals in patients presenting to the ED or ofﬁce with acute chest pain are: 1) identify life-threatening causes; 2) determine clinical stability; and 3) assess need for hospi- talization versus safety of outpatient evaluation and management. These concerns entail consideration of the full extent of clinical da ta. The ACC/AHA STEMI and NSTE-ACS guidelines categorize chest pain cause into 4 types: STEMI, NSTE-ACS, stable angina, and noncardiac (6,7) .T h e1 2 - l e a dE C G ,w h i c hs h o u l db ea c q u i r e da n d interpreted within 10 minut es of arrival to a medical fa- cility (1-7,11)( Section 2.3.2 , ECG), is pivotal in the evalu- ation because of its capacity to identify and triage patients with STEMI to urgent coronary reperfusion. Other ST-T abnormalities consistent with possible ischemia also mandate prompt evaluation in a hospital setting. In both cases, transfer should be by EMS; personal automobile for this purpose is associated with increased risk and should be avoided ( 3-5). Patients with stable angina or noncardiac chest pain that is not life- threatening should be managed as outpatients. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. The ECG is central to the evaluation of stable angina in the of ﬁce setting to ensure that ACS is not missed (1,2,6,7). If an ECG cannot be obtained, transfer to the ED should be initiated. 2. Transfer by EMS from the ofﬁce setting for acute chest pain with suspected ACS or other life-threating condi- tions is recommended because of the important ad- vantages provided by EMS including: 1) acquisition of a prehospital ECG, which can facilitate reperfusion if ST elevation is present; 2) presence of trained personnel who can provide treatment for chest pain, arrhythmias, and implement deﬁbrillation en route; and 3) shorter travel time to the ED (1-7,10). 3. Early recognition of STEMI improves outcomes (1-3,6,7). Therefore, regardless of the setting, an ECG should be obtained and interpreted within 10 minutes of arrival. If this cannot be achieved in the of ﬁce setting, immediate transfer to the ED by EMS is rec- ommended. A substantial proportion of patients with chest pain are transferred to the ED without a pre- hospital ECG (1-3,6,7). This results in an important and avoidable delay in readiness of the ED and reperfusion teams to implement optimally timed reperfusion therapy (1-7,10). 4. cTn is the most sensitive test for diagnosing acute myocardial injury and, in conjunction with other e s s e n t i a lc l i n i c a ld a t a( e . g . ,h i s t o r y ,e x a m i n a t i o n ,E C G ) , its measurement is necessary to implement appro- priate therapy (8,9). 5. Delayed transfer to the hospital for determination of cTn or other diagnostic testing beyond the ECG in the ofﬁce setting can be detrimental and should be avoided (1-7,10). 2.3.2. Electrocardiogram Recommendations for Electrocardiogram Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 6 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 C-EO 1. In patients with chest pain in which an initial ECGis nondiagnostic, serial ECGs to detect potential ischemic changes should be performed, especially whe n clinical suspicion of ACS is high, symptoms are persistent, or the clinical condition deteriorates ( 1). 1 C-EO 2. Patients with chest pain in whom the initial ECG is consistent with an ACS should be treated according to STEMI and NSTE-ACS guidelines (1,2). 2a B-NR 3. In patients with chest pain and intermediate-to-high clinical suspicion for ACS in whom the initial ECG is nondiagnostic, supplemental electrocardiographic leads V7 to V9 are reasonable to rule out posterior MI (3-5). Synopsis Patients with chest pain and new ST-elevation, ST depression, or new left bundle branch block on ECG should be treated according to STEMI and NSTE-ACS guidelines ( 1,2,6). An initial normal ECG does not exclude ACS. Patients with an initial normal ECG should have a repeat ECG, if symptoms are ongoing, until other diagnostic testing rules out ACS. An ECG may identify other nonischemic causes of chest pain (e.g., pericarditis, myocarditis, arrhythmia, electrolyte abnormalities, paced rhythm, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hy- pertension, congenital long QT, or normal variant). Figure 4 depicts an algorithm for the role of the ECG to help direct care for individuals presenting with chest pain or chest pain equivalents. Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. When an ECG is nondiagnostic, it should be compared with previous ECGs, if available ( 7). A normal or un- changed ECG is reasonably useful but not sufﬁcient at JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al. NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 2021 Chest Pain Guideline e203 ruling out ACS ( 8-10). Thus, decision-making should not be based solely on a single normal or nondiagnostic ECG. Left ventricular hypertrophy, bundle branch blocks, and ventricular pacing may mask signs of ischemia or injury ( 11). Up to 6% of patients with evolving ACS are discharged from the ED with a normal ECG (12-17 ). In patients where the initial ECG is normal or is without ST elevation, hyperacute T waves, left bundle branch block, or ST depression, serial ECGs should be performed and management should be guided by new electrocardiographic changes or other diagnostic testing (see Section 2.3.4 on Biomarkers, Section 3.1 on Anatomic Testing, or Section 3.2 on Stress Testing) ( 7,18-20 ). The timing for repeat ECG should also be guided by symptoms, especially if chest pain recurs or a change in clinical condition develops (21). 2. When ST-elevation is present on the initial ECG, man- agement should follow the prescribed STEMI treatment algorithms in associated guidelines ( 2,22). Further- more, if ST depression is identiﬁed on the initial ECG, management should follow the NSTE-ACS guidelines (1). 3. A normal ECG may be associated with left circumﬂex or right coronary artery occl usions and posterior wall ischemia, which is often“electrically silent ”; therefore, right-sided ECG leads should be considered when such lesions are suspected (2-5). 2.3.3. Chest Radiography Recommendation for Chest Radiography COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 C-EO 1. In patients presenting with acute chest pain, a chest radiograph is useful to evaluate for other potential cardiac, pulmonary, and thoracic causes of symptoms. FIGURE 4 Electrocardiographic-Directed Management of Chest Pain ECG indicates electrocardiogram; NSTE-ACS, non–ST-segment–elevation acute coronary syndrome; MI, myocardial infarction; and STEMI, ST-segment– elevation myocardial infarction. Gulati et al. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 2021 Chest Pain Guideline NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 e204 Synopsis Chest radiographs are rapid, noninvasive tests that can be used to screen for several disorders that may present with chest pain. The yield of chest radiography depends on the pretest probability and will thus be higher when history or physical examination point to a greater likelihood of a given diagnosis. However, chest radiographs often do not lead to a diagnosis that requires intervention ( 1), and their use should be guided by clinical suspicion. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. The AHA/ACC guidelines for NSTE-ACS and heart fail- ure all recommend chest radiographs on presentation, although this should not delay urgent revascularization if it is indicated (2,3). In patients with acute chest pain and heart failure, chest radiographs are useful to assess heart size and pulmonary congestion, as well as iden- tifying potential pulmonary causes that may have contributed to symptoms. Chest radiographs may demonstrate a widened mediastinum in patients with aortic dissection, although they are not sensitive enough in this setting to rule out the diagnosis ( 4). Chest radiographs may be most useful in the evaluation of patients with acute chest pain to detect alternative cardiac, pulmonary, or other conditions that may cause symptoms, including pneumonia, pneumothorax, or rib fractures. Pleural effusions , pulmonary artery enlarge- ment, and in ﬁltrates may suggest PE, which would need to be conﬁrmed by further testing. 2.3.4. Biomarkers Recommendations for Biomarkers Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 7 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. In patients presenting with acute chest pain, serial cTn I or T levels are useful to identify abnormal values and a rising or falling pattern indicative of acute myocardial injury (1-21). 1 B-NR 2. In patients presenting with acute chest pain, high-sensitivity cTn is the preferred biomarker because it enables more rapid detection or exclusion of myocardial injury and increases diagnostic accuracy (17,21-25 ). 1 C-EO 3. Clinicians should be familiar with the analytical performance and the 99th percentile upper reference limit that deﬁnes myocardial injury for the cTn assay used at their institution (23,26). 3: No beneﬁt B-NR 4. With availability of cTn, creatine kinase myocardial (CK-MB) isoenzyme and myoglobin are not useful for diagnosis of acute myocardial injury (27-32 ). Synopsis Cardiovascular biomarkers can be useful for the diag- nostic and prognostic assessment of patients with chest pain. Their most important application in clinical practice is for the rapid identiﬁcation or exclusion of myocardial injury. The preferred biomarker to detect or exclude myocardial injury is cTn (I or T) because of its high sensitivity and speci ﬁcity for myocardial tissue (1-21,33). hs-cTn is preferred and can detect circulating cTn in the blood of most “healthy ” individuals, with different sex- speci ﬁc thresholds ( 17,21,34). cTn is organ-speci ﬁcb u t not disease-speci ﬁc. Numerous ischemic, noncoronary cardiac, and noncardiac causes of cardiomyocyte injury c a nr e s u l ti ne l e v a t e dc T nc o n c e n t r a t i o n s(17,21,24,25). Therefore, interpretation of cTn results requires integra- tion with all clinical information (17,21). Although multiple other cardiovascular biomarkers, including some in common clinical use such as natriuretic peptides, have been shown to be associated with the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chest p a i n ,n o n eh a v es u fﬁcient diagnostic accuracy for myocardial injury to be recommended for that purpose.

The preferred biomarker to detect or exclude cardiac injury is cTn (I or T) because of its high sensitivity and speci ﬁcity for myocardial tissue ( 1-21). Detection of myocardial cell injury, possibly indicative of AMI, is predicated on a rise or fall of this biomarker in blood (1,3,4,10-21 ). A cTn concentration >99th percentile JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al. NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 2021 Chest Pain Guideline e205 upper reference limit, which is assay-dependent, is an indicator of myocardial injury (1,9,21). The coefﬁcient of variation at the 99th percentile upper reference limit for each assay should be#10% (8,21). 2. There is ample evidence for the superiority of hs-cTn assays over conventional cTn assays in multiple as- pects of evaluation for patients presenting with chest pain with and without AMI (17,21,24,25,33). The sensi- tivity and negative predictive values are greater with hs-cTn compared with previous generation assays (17,21,24,25). In addition, the time interval from onset of chest pain to a detectable concentration at patient presentation is shorter with hs-cTn, affording more r a p i dr u l e - i na n dr u l e - o u ta l g o r i t h m s(22). Although it is sometimes challenging to diagnostically discrimi- nate among these causes of myocardial injury, irre- spective of the ﬁnal diagnosis, the presence of myocardial injury is associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes among patients with chest pain (35). 3. The level of detection, 99th percentile upper reference limit, analytical precision, and criteria for a signiﬁcant delta are assay-speci ﬁc, including among the many different manufacturers o ft h es a m ea n a l y t e( e . g . , hs-cTnI). To appropriately apply a cTn assay, clinicians must be familiar with these analytical performance properties for the assay(s) that they use in their prac- tice (21). 4. Comparative studies have conﬁrmed the superiority of cTn over CK-MB and myoglobin for diagnosis and prognosis of AMI ( 27-32 ). The addition of CK-MB or myoglobin to cTn for evaluation of patients presenting with chest pain is not beneﬁcial. 3. CARDIAC TESTING GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS For acute and stable chest pain, noninvasive and invasive diagnostic testing is a core component of the evaluation underpinning its importance. Over the past decade, the quality of evidence supporting clinical indications for noninvasive testing has grown dramatically. The approach outlined in this guideline focuses on selective use of testing, optimizatio n of lower cost evaluations, reducing layered testing, a nd deferring or eliminating testing when the diagnostic yield is low ( Figure 5 ). FIGURE 5 Chest Pain and Cardiac Testing Considerations The choice of imaging depends on the clinical question of importance, to either a) ascertain the diagnosis of CAD and deﬁne coronary anatomy or b) assess ischemia severity among patients with an expected higher likelihood of ischemia with an abnormal resting ECG or those incapable of performing maximal exercise. ACS indicates acute coronary syndrome; CAC, coronary artery calcium; CAD, coronary artery disease; and ECG, electrocardiogram. Please refer toSection 4.1. For risk assessment in acute chest pain, seeFigure 9. For risk assessment in stable chest pain, seeFigure 11. Gulati et al. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 2021 Chest Pain Guideline NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 e206 Reducing unnecessary testing can provide a means to exert cost savings within the diagnostic evaluation of populations ( 1). In the same manner, elimination of testing where evidence is lacking and the reduction in testing among low-risk pa tients for whom deferred testing is appropriate are emphasized in this guideline. Testing choice will be inﬂuenced by site expertise and availability, but knowledge regarding which test may be preferable is useful when selecting between different modalities. Cost should also be considered, when known by the ordering clinician and there is equipoise between available modalities ( 2) .T h ee x e r c i s eE C Gi st h el o w e s t cost procedure used in the diagnostic evaluation when compared with stress imaging or anatomic procedures, with the exception of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring (Figure 6). For all imaging procedures, costs vary by payer and site of services. The following sections provide a brief overview of the various noninvasive tests available for use in the eval- uation of symptomatic patients. Previously, the term known as CAD had been used to de ﬁne those with a signi ﬁcant obstructive stenosis (i.e., $50%). In this guideline, we revise the term known CAD to include patients with prior anatomic testing (invasive angiog- raphy or coronary computed tomographic angiography [CCTA]) with identi ﬁed nonobstructive atherosclerotic plaque and obstructive CAD. We recognize this is a de- parture from convention, but our intent was to ensure that those with lesser degrees of stenosis who do not require coronary intervention but would bene ﬁtf r o m optimized preventive therapy do not get overlooked. However, throughout the document, the term “obstruc- tive”, consistent with convention, will be used to indi- cate CAD with $50% stenosis and nonobstructive CAD will be used to indicate CAD<50% stenosis. In addition, the term “high risk CAD” is used to denote patients with obstructive stenosis who have left main stenosis $50% or anatomically signi ﬁcant 3-vessel disease ( $70% stenosis). 3.1. Anatomic Testing 3.1.1. Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography CCTA can visualize and help to diagnose the extent and severity of nonobstructive and obstructive CAD, as well as atherosclerotic plaque composition and high-risk features (e.g., positive remodeling, low attenuation plaque) ( 1-8). Calculation of fractional ﬂow reserve with CT (FFR-CT) provides an estimation of lesion-speci ﬁci s c h e m i a(9). Current radiation dosimetry is low for CCTA, with effec- tive doses for most patients in the 3 to 5 mSv range (10). CCTA contraindications are reported in Table 5 Although in select situations imaging protocols that evaluate the coronary arteries, aorta, and pulmonary arteries may be useful, the general approach should be to use imaging protocols tailored to the most likely diagnosis, rather than a “triple rule out” approach (Figure 6). 3.1.2. Invasive Coronary Angiography Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) deﬁnes the presence and severity of a luminal obstruction of an epicardial coronary artery, including its location, length, and diam- eter, as well as coronary blood ﬂow ( 1,2). For ICA, the primary goal is the characterization and detection of a high-grade obstructive stenosis to de ﬁne feasibility and necessity of percutaneous or surgical revascularization. The use of physiologic indices (IFR and FFR) provides complementary functi onal information ( 1). Radiation exposure to the patient during an interventional proced- ure averages 4 to 10 mSv and is dependent on procedural duration and complexity (3,4). ICA has a spatial resolution of 0.3 mm; as such, it is impossible to visualize arterioles (diameter of 0.1 mm) that regulate myocardial bloodﬂow (5). Coronary vascular functional studies can be performed during coronary angiography. Normal angiography does not exclude abnormal coronary vascular function, and it is possible to assess coronary microcirculation and coronary vaso- motion. Coronary function testing may assist in manage- ment of the underlying condition, in addition to providing prognostic information ( 6-8). 3.2. Diagnostic Testing 3.2.1. Exercise ECG Symptom-limited exercise ECG involves graded exercise until physical fatigue, limiting chest pain (or discomfort), marked ischemia, or a drop in blood pressure occurs (1).

Ex ercise electrocardiographic contraindication s are reported inTable 5. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al. NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 2021 Chest Pain Guideline e207 3.2.2. Echocardiography/Stress Echocardiography Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can visualize and aid in the differential diagnosis among the numerous causes of acute chest pain such as acute aortic dissection, pericardial effusion, str ess cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( 1,2). Although TTE does provide information, for patients with acute chest pain, visualization of left and right ventricular function and regional wall motion abnormalities allows for the assess- ment of CAD risk and may help to guide clinical decision- FIGURE 6 Choosing the Right Diagnostic Test ASCVD indicates atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CAD, coronary artery disease; CAC, coronary artery calcium; CCTA, coronary computed tomography angiog- raphy; CMR, cardiovascular magnetic resonance; ETT, exercise tolerance test; LV, left ventricular; MPI, myocardial perfusion imaging; PET, positron emission to- mography and SPECT, single-photon emission computed tomography. Gulati et al. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 2021 Chest Pain Guideline NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 e208 making. Performance of TTE at the bedside is ideal for patients with acute chest pain and can be done using point-of-care or handheld devices in institutions where such capabilities are available. After ACS has been ruled out, stress echocardiography can be used to de ﬁne ischemia severity and for risk strati ﬁcation purposes. For TTE and stress echocardiog- raphy, ultrasound-enhancing agents are helpful for left ventricular opaci ﬁcation when $2 contiguous segments or a coronary territory is poorly visualized (3). Coronary ﬂow velocity reserve in the mid-distal left anterior descending coronary artery has been shown to improve risk stratiﬁcation and may be helpful in the select patient with known CAD, including nonobstructive CAD ( 4-6). Contraindications to stress type (exercise versus phar- macologic) and stress echocardiography are reported in Table 5. 3.2.3. Stress Nuclear (PET or SPECT) Myocardial Perfusion Imaging After ACS has been ruled out, rest/stress positron emis- sion tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) allows for detection of perfusion abnormalities, measures of left ventricular function, and high-risk ﬁndings, such as transient ischemic dilation (1- 8). For PET, calculation of myocardial bloodﬂow reserve (MBFR, the ratio of peak hyperemia to resting myocar- dial blood ﬂow) adds diagnostic and prognostic infor- mation over MPI data ( 9-14). Radiation exposure, as reported by an average effective dose, is w3m S vf o r rest/stress PET with Rb-82 and w10 mSv for Tc-99m SPECT; dual- isotope SPECT using thallium is not rec- ommended (15-17 ). SPECT/PET contraindications are and contraindications to type of s tress test (exercise versus pharmacologic) are reported in Table 5. 3.2.4. Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has the capability to accurately assess global and regional left and right ventricular function, detect and localize myocardial ischemia and infarction, and determine myocardial viability. CMR can also detect myocardial edema and micr ovascular obstruction, which can help differentiate acute versus chronic MI, as well as other causes of acute chest pain, including myocarditis. CMR contraindications are reported in Table 5 .

Cardiac Testing Considerations for Women Who Are Pregnant, Postpartum, or of Child-Bearing Age This guideline focuses on elective and urgent cardiac testing and, in both circumstances, imaging using ionizing radiation during pregnancy or postpartum while breast feeding should generally be avoided. When imag- ing is necessary to guide management, the risks and beneﬁts of invasive angiography, SPECT, PET, or CCTA should be discussed with the patient. In all cases for a test deemed clinically necessary, the lowest effective dose of ionizing radiation should be used, including consider- ations for tests with no radiation exposure (e.g., echo- cardiography, CMR imaging) ( 1). Radiation risk to the fetus is very small. Iodinated contrast enters the fetal circulation through the placenta and should be used with caution in a pregnant woman. The use of gadolinium contrast with CMR should be discouraged and used only when necessary to guide clinical management and is ex- pected to improve fetal or maternal outcome ( 2-5). If contrast is needed for a postpartum woman, breastfeed- ing may continue because <1% of iodinated contrast is excreted into the breast milk and absorbed into the in- fant’s gastrointestinal tract (6). 4. CHOOSING THE RIGHT PATHWAY WITH PATIENT-CENTRIC ALGORITHMS FOR ACUTE CHEST PAIN After initial evaluation, the next step is determining whether further diagnostic testing is needed to establish a diagnosis or formulate a disposition plan. In some cases, there is clearly minimal risk of a serious medical condition although, in others, uncertainty may remain. We provide guidance to help clinicians make this determination within the context of acute and stable chest pain presentations. The initial assessment of patients presenting with acute chest pain is focused on the rapid identiﬁcation of patients with immediately life-threatening conditions such that appropriate medical interventions can be initiated. Included among the potentially life-threatening (emer- gency) causes of chest pain are ACS (Section 4.1), acute aortic syndromes ( Section 4.2.1), and PE (Section 4.2.2).

A subset of noncardiovascular syndromes are also immediately life-threatening, including esophageal rupture (Section 4.3.1), tension pneumothorax, and sickle cell chest crisis. Nonemergency causes of chest pain, such as costochondritis and other musculoskeletal, or gastrointestinal causes, are discussed in Section 4.3.S u c h nonemergency causes predominate among patients pre- senting with acute chest pain; therefore, strategies that incorporate routine, liberal use of testing carry the potential for adverse effects of unnecessary investigations and un- necessary cost. Figure 7 provides an overview of this approach. FIGURE 7 Patient-Centric Algorithms for Acute Chest Pain ECG indicates electrocardiogram; and STEMI, ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction.

Patients With Acute Chest Pain and Suspected ACS (Not Including STEMI) Synopsis Patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS cover a spectrum of disease likelihood and strati ﬁcation into low- versus intermediate- or high-risk groups once STEMI has been excluded ( Figure 8 ). This strati ﬁcation is important to guide subsequent management. Although most high-risk patients identi ﬁed by CDPs should un- dergo cardiac catheterization, these patients still require a clinical assessment to determine if invasive evaluation is appropriate. Chest pain risk scores provide a summative assessment combining clinical information, such as age, ST segment changes on ECG, symptoms, CAD risk factors, and cTn (Table 6)t oe s t i m a t eap a t i e n t’s probability of ACS or risk of 30-day major adverse card iovascular events (MACE) (30-35 ). Risk scores are essential when conventional cTn assays are used. Based on emerging data, the hs-cTn result may be more predictive than other clinical com- ponents of the risk score (36-43 ). Chest pain protocols are intended to add structure to the process of patient evaluation. Although various terms such as accelerated diagnostic protocols or disposition pathways have been used to describe such protocols, they can collectively be referred to as CDPs. CDPs are generally used to help guide disposition, but some also include guidance for cardiac testing of intermediate-risk patients (30,31,33,34). Compared with an unstructured clinical assessment, CDPs have been shown to decrease unnecessary testing and reduce admissions while maintaining high sensitivity for detection of acute myocardial injury and 30-day MACE (Table 6 ). The warranty period of prior cardiac testing should be considered when symptoms are unchanged (Table 7). Low-risk chest pain has been deﬁned inTable 8. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. CDPs that are based on cTn results have proven valid and useful in clinical practice (1-14). Use of unstructured assessment for clinical decision-making often leads to both under- and overtesting. To improve on this, pro- tocols have been developed to rapidly detect (rule in) and to rapidly exclude or “rule out” acute myocardial injury, incorporating time-dependent serial cTn sam- pling. Some protocols include chest pain risk scores while others do not. CDPs have been shown to help avoid admission or further testing in 21.3% to 43% of eligible patients and should be routinely used in clinical practice (31,45,50). To standardize the approach to pa- tient care and ensure consistency in decision-making, CDPs should be implemented at the institution level. There are multiple CDPs from which to choose, and all generally involve single o r serial cTn measurement. B e c a u s et h e r ea r es e v e r a ld ifferent manufacturers, the Recommendations for Patients With Acute Chest Pain and Suspected ACS (Not Including STEMI) Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 8 and 9. COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. In patients presenting with acute chest pain and suspected ACS, clinical decision pathways (CDPs) should categorize patients into low-, intermediate-, and high -risk strata to facilitate disposition and subsequent diagnostic evaluation ( 1-14). 1 B-NR 2. In the evaluation of patients presenting with acutechest pain and suspected ACS for whom serial troponins are indicated to exclude myocardial injury, recommen ded time intervals after the initial troponin sample collection (time zero) for repeat measurements are: 1 to 3 hours for high-sensitivity troponin and 3 to 6 hours for conventional troponin assays (15-17 ). 1 C-LD 3. To standardize the detection and differentiation of myocardial injury in patients presenting with acute chest pain and suspected ACS, institutions should implement a CDP that includes a protocol for troponin sampling based on their particular assay (18,19) 1 C-LD 4.

For patients with acute chest pain, a normal ECG, and symptoms suggestive of ACS that began at least 3 hours before ED arrival, a single hs-cTn concentration that is below the limit of detection on initial measurement (time zero) is reasonable to exclude myocardial injury (13,25-29 ).

CDPs are more likely to be successful when they incorporate multidisciplinary teams. 2. There are important differences in the performance of highly sensitive and conventional cTn assays. hs-cTn assays may be used to guide disposition by repeat s a m p l i n ga t1 ,2 ,o r3h o u r sf r o mE Da r r i v a lu s i n gt h e pattern of rise or fall (i.e., delta) and the repeat value itself, based on assay-speci ﬁcd i a g n o s t i ct h r e s h o l d s (37-43 ). When using conventional cTn assays, the sampling timeframe is extended to 3 to 6 hours from ED arrival (36). 3. CDPs that include risk scores all perform well overall, with 99% to 100% sensitivity for index- visit AMI and 30-day MACE and have been shown to decrease advanced testing to varying degrees a n ds h o u l db eu s e dp a r t i c u l a r l yw i t hc o n v e n t i o n a l cTn ( 2,13,30-35 ). However, because sex-speci ﬁc considerations are not included in all scoring sys- tems, their effectiveness in men and women may not be equal ( 51). 4. Previous test results should always be considered in the evaluation of patients with acute chest pain once ACS has been ruled out. In those with recent cardiac testing and normal ﬁn d i n g sw h od on o th a v e biomarker evidence of acute myocardial injury, further testing is of limited value, provided that adequate ex- ercise levels were achieved or pharmacologic stress was performed, imaging was of sufﬁcient quality, and there are no changes in symptom frequency or stability at the new visit. The“warranty ” intervals (Table 7)f o r the various cardiac testing modalities differ because of the low number of incident events among patients with a normal CCTA, although patients with normal stress testing may still have signiﬁcant plaque and a higher event rate (20-22 ). The warranty period for a normal stress-rest SPECT is highly variable because it is pri- marily determined by the type of stress, the patient’s clinical characteristics, and left ventricular ejection fraction (52). 5. To use cTn properly, an understanding of the assay used (high sensitivity or conventional) and the timing of chest pain onset relative to ED arrival is critical (17,38,39). CDPs that emphasize rapid rule-out based on single hs-cTn concentrations below the limit of detection should be limited to patients whose symp- toms started at least 3 hours before ED arrival (2,5,6,11,14,16,25,40-43 ,53-55 ). Unlike high-sensitivity assays, clinical decision-making based on single mea- surement of conventional cTn has not been validated (36). If the clinical presentation is still suspicious for ACS or diagnostic uncertainty remains after serial cTn measurement, it may be reasonable to repeat cTn assay later (i.e., beyond 3 hours for high-sensitivity and beyond 6 hours for conventional assays) ( 23,40,41). 4.1.1.

Recommendations for Low-Risk Patients With Acute Chest Pain Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 10 and 11. COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. Patients with acute chest painand a 30-day risk of death or MACE<1% should be designated as low risk (1-11). 2a B-R 2. In patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS who are deemed low-risk (<1% 30-day risk of death or MACE), it is reasonable to discharge home without admission or urgent cardiac testing (12-16 ). JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al. NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 2021 Chest Pain Guideline e215 Low-risk patients are those with symptoms suggestive of ACS and whose probability of MACE within 30 days is #1% (17). This estimate is based on clinical information that is readily available during the course of evaluation, typically occurring in the ED. There are several methods to determine that a patient is low risk ( Table 8 )b u t , invariably, all involve taking an appropriate history and physical examination, demonstration that the ECG is normal, nonischemic, or unchanged from the previous E C G ,a n dc T nm e a s u r e m e n ta tas i n g l ep o i n ti nt i m e( i f presentation is >3 hours from symptom onset and using a high-sensitivity assay) or serially ( 1-11)( w i t hi n c o r p o r a - tion of a chest pain risk score into the CDP if using a conventional cTn assay). Importantly, there is no evi- dence to support routine admission or cardiac testing for chest pain patients who are low risk, although outpatient CAC scanning can provide additional information for longer-term risk strati ﬁcation. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. A large proportion of patients presenting to the ED with chest pain are low risk based on a combination of fea- tures, including clinical stability, medical history, nonischemic ECG, and absence of acute myocardial injury on cTn measurement. Such individuals have a <1% frequency of ACS or MACE at 30 days ( 1-11). Although achieving this with conventional cTn assays requires incorporation of risk scores into a CPD, hs-cTn results can be used on their own. This approach has been validated based on 15 studies including a total of >9,600 patients, with a demonstrated negative pre- d i c t i v ev a l u ef o rM Io rd e a t ha t3 0d a y so f9 9 . 8 %(11). These ﬁndings re ﬂect studies involving both hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT using serial measurement algorithms or as i n g l eh s - c T n ,p r o v i d e dt h eﬁnal measurement is performed $3 hours after the onset of symptoms, without incorporation of risk scores. 2. For this low-risk subset of ED patients who have chest pain, there is no evidence that stress testing or cardiac imaging within 30 days of the index ED visit improves their outcomes ( 18). This represents a change from previous guidelines where stress testing within 72 hours was broadly recommended for patients with acute chest pain (19). However, many of these patients have baseline cardiac risk factors that need to be managed. Pathways to facilitate outpatient follow-up for further evaluation and guideline-directed manage- ment of cardiac risk factors should be considered. Among patients presenting to the ED with chest pain, t h e r ei sas e p a r a t eg r o u pt h a ti sa ts u c hl o wr i s ko f having atherosclerotic plaque or 30-day MACE that they do not even need CDP-based risk stratiﬁcation. 4.1.1.1. Cost-Value Considerations in the Evaluation of Low-Risk Patients The costs associated with the acute evaluation of chest pain have been examined within systematic reviews, health technology appraisals, and data collected in the o b s e r v a t i o n a lo rr a n d o m i z e dc l i n i c a lt r i a ls e t t i n g(1-10). The decision analytic models suggest that the use of hs-Tn can be cost effective as a rule-out for ACS, primarily attributable to prompt discharge of patients without hs-Tn elevations (2,8,11,12). Moreover, hs-Tn–guided diagnostic strategies also reduced the use of stress testing by nearly one-third ( 13). From a large multicenter registry, the reduced time to discharge and use of noninvasive testing contributed to a cost savings of 20% (13). Nonadherence to management recommendations impact the potential for cost savings ( 5). From a randomized trial applying the HEART Pathway, a modest 30-day cost savings of $216 per TABLE 8 Deﬁnition Used for Low-Risk Patients With Chest Pain Low Risk (<1% 30-d Risk for Death or MACE) hs-cTn Based T-0 T-0 hs-cTn below the assay limit of detection or “very low” threshold if symptoms present for at least 3 h T-0 and 1- or 2-h Delta T-0 hs-cTn and 1- or 2-h delta are both below the assay “low” thresholds (>99% NPV for 30-d MACE) Clinical Decision Pathway Based HEART Pathway (20) HEART score #3, initial and serial cTn/hs-cTn< assay 99th percentile EDACS (14) EDACS score #16; initial and serial cTn/hs-cTn< assay 99th percentile ADAPT (21) TIMI score 0, initial and serial cTn/hs-cTn < assay 99th percentile mADAPT TIMI score 0/1, initial and serial cTn/hs-cTn < assay 99th percentile NOTR (15) 0 factors ADAPT indicates 2-hour Accelerated Diagnostic Protocol to Access Patients with Chest Pain Symptoms Using Contemporary Troponins as the Only Biomarkers; cTn, cardiac troponin; EDACS, Emergency Department Acute Coronary Syndrome; HEART Pathway, History, ECG, Age, Risk Factors, Troponin; hs-cTn, high-sensitivity cardiactroponin; MACE, major adverse cardiovascular events; mADAPT, modiﬁed 2-hour Accelerated Diagnostic Protocol to Access Patients with Chest Pain Symptoms Using Contemporary Troponins as the Only Biomarkers; NOTR, No Objective Testing Rule; NPV, negative predictive value; and TIMI, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction.

However, the overall reductions in hospital admission and length of stay impacted population estimates for cost savings from 1 ED registry of 30,769 patients presenting before and 23,699 patients presenting after i mplementation of an acceler- ated diagnostic pathway and resulted in a total cost reduction of $13.5 million (Australian) (7). Thus, improved process ef ﬁciency and discharge of low-risk patients largely results in overall cost reductions. 4.1.2. Intermediate-Risk Patients With Acute Chest Pain Recommendations for Intermediate-Risk Patients With Acute Chest Pain Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 12 and 13. COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 C-EO 1. For intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain, TTE is recommended as a rapid, bedside test to establish baseline ventricular and valvular function, evaluate for wall motion abnormalities, and to assess for pericardial effusion. 2a A 2. For intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain, management in an observation unit is reasonable to s h o r t e nl e n g t ho fs t a ya n dl o w e rc o s tr e l a t i v et oa ni n p a t i e n ta d m i s s i o n(1-7). Synopsis Patients in the ED without high-risk features and not classi ﬁed as low risk by a CDP fall into an intermediate- risk group. Intermediate-r isk patients do not have evi- dence of acute myocardial injury by troponin but remain candidates for additional cardiac testing. Some may have chronic or minor troponin elevations. This testing often requires more time than is appropriate for an ED visit. These patients may be placed in an inpatient bed or managed in a dedicated observation unit using a chest pain protocol. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Prompt use of TTE allows for an evaluation of cardiac cause for symptoms and evaluation of alternative pathol- ogies for acute chest pain (8-13). Rapid echocardiographic assessment may facilitate imaging of patients while they are symptomatic. Point-of-care echocardiograms per- formed at the bedside by properly trained clinicians and technicians may be particularly useful. 2. The additional testing needed for intermediate-risk patients often requires more time than is appropriate for an ED visit and is often performed under“observation” outpatient sta- tus. These patients may be placed in an inpatient bed or managed in a dedicated observation unit. Relative to care in an inpatient bed, dedicated observation units have been shown to decrease hospital admissions, length of stay, and cost while improving inpatient bed availability and chest pain patient satisfaction (1-7). 4.1.2.1. Intermediate-Risk Patients With Acute Chest Pain and No Known (CAD) Recommendations for Intermediate-Risk Patients With No Known CAD Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 14 and 15. COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS Index Diagnostic Testing Anatomic Testing 1A 1. For intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain and no known CAD eligible for diagnostic testing after a negative or inconclusive evaluation for ACS, CCTA is useful for exclusion of atherosclerotic plaque and obstructive CAD (1-11). 1 C-EO 2. For intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain, moderate-severe ischemia on current or prior (£1 year) stress testing, and no known CAD established by prior anatomic testing, ICA is recommended. 2a C-LD 3. For intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain with evidence of previous mildly abnormal stress test results (£1 year), CCTA is reasonable for diagnosing obstructive CAD (12,13). JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al. NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 2021 Chest Pain Guideline e217 Synopsis For patients with recent prior testing and normalﬁnd- ings, no further testing is indicated, given adequate exer- cise levels were achieved or pharmacologic stress was performed and if imaging was of sufﬁcient quality, pro- vided there are no changes in symptom frequency or sta- bility at the new visit. The intervals (1 year for stress testing, 2 years for CCTA without plaque or stenosis) differ because of a lack of CAD progression and the low number of incident events among patients with a normal CCTA, although patients with normal stress testing may still have signi ﬁcant plaque and a higher event rate (44-46 ). With a previously inconclusive or mildly abnormal stress test in the past year, CCTA is recommended, avoiding the poten- tial for inconclusive results if the same type of test is repeated and enabling a more de ﬁnitive rule-out of obstructive CAD. Among patients who present with acute chest pain who have had moderate-severe abnormalities on previous testing, but no interval anatomic testing, direct referral to ICA may be helpful for diagnosis of obstructive CAD. Among those without a previous diagnostic evaluation and no known CAD, CCTA or stress testing may be the initial method of testing. S econd-line testing may be helpful for patients with an initial inconclusive stress test. Similarly, for intermediate- risk patients with an inter- mediate stenosis on CCTA, FFR-CT, or stress testing may also be indicated. ICA is indicated for patients categorized as high risk on a validated risk score (Figure 9). However, patients with an intermediate-risk score may also be candidates for CCTA or ICA if moderate-severe ischemia or signi ﬁcant left ventricular dysfunction is detected on index diag- nostic testing. Although there are several acceptable testing modal- ities for intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain, the decision to use one versus another should be guided by local expertise and availability. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text Anatomic Testing 1. In the ED evaluation of patients with acute chest pain, CCTA contributes to a reduced time to diagnosis and prompt discharge, without impacting safety (i.e., no difference in death, repeat ED visits, or ACS over 1 to 6 months of follow- up) compared with a standard evaluation including stress testing (1-4,8,47-50). Long-term prognostic data are limited, but the CATCH (Cardiac CT in the Treatment of Acute Chest Pain) trial showed a relative hazard for CAD events atw18 months of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.40–0.98; p¼0.04) for CCTA versus a standard care strategy (48). Similar 40-month MACE rates were reported in the PROSPECT (Providing Regional Ob- servations to Study Predictors of Events in the Coronary Tree) trial comparing CCTA- versus MPI-directed strategies (p¼0.29) (10). Similar 2-year outcomes were also reported for stress echocardiography and CCTA (p¼0.47) (29). 2. In patients who have evidence of moderate or severe ischemia on previous stress testing, who were not revascularized, and who present with acute chest pain, additional noninvasive str ess testing is unlikely to result in any change in management. Such patients are assumed to have signiﬁcant ﬂow-limiting CAD and can proceed directly to an invasive evaluation if coronary revascularization is consistent with the goals of care. A sizeable proportion of patients with moderate-severe ischemia do not undergo ICA (51,52) and may require additional assessment, if repeat symptoms occur. 3. Symptomatic patients with inconclusive or mildly abnormal stress tests often have an increased risk of MACE (53). Patients with previous stress testing often have atherosclerotic plaque and are at risk for obstructive CAD lesions (12,13). Stress Testing 1 B-NR 4.

Stress Testing 4. Among patients evaluated in the ED who need further testing, exercise ECG is safe with most patients having negative studies and a low risk of ACS (1,4,10,14-31 , 54). Stress echocardiography is safe and effective for triage and prompt discharge of patients and is associated with few events among those with normal or low-riskﬁndings over near-term follow-up of up to 6 months (17,18,36). Prompt stress echocardiogr aphy resulted in a reduction in ED and hospital length of stay, compared with CCTA, with similar 2-year MACE rates (p¼0.47) (29). In the ED evaluation of patients with acute chest pain, a nuclear MPI strategy is similarly safe when compared with CCTA with no difference in MACE (death, ACS, or stroke) over follow-up of 6 to 12 months. Longer-term follow-up data from the PROSPECT trial ( 10) supported that at w3.5 years, the rate of MACE was similar between MPI and CCTA (p¼0.29) (10) .C o m p a r e dw i t hC C T A ,u s eo fs t r e s s MPI delayed the time to diagnosis by >50% ( 1,4). Furthermore, recent observation from 213 patients referred for rest-stress MPIwith mildly abnormal hs-cTn values reported no adverse events related to the tests and a modest 13.6% yield for ischemic studies ( 55). Single-center, small (n ¼105) randomized trial evidence suggests that stress CMR is safe without a near-term (90- day) increase in hospital readmission or additional testing ( 32-34 ). From a single-center registry (n ¼135), stress CMR was associated with a high sensitivity (100%) and speciﬁcity (93%) for the detection of obstructive CAD or cardiovascular events at 1 year (35). Sequential or Add-on Testing 5. Patients with coronary artery stenosis of 40% to 90% in a proximal or middle coronary segment on CCTA may beneﬁt from measurement of FFR-CT (37-43 ). In a large registry of 555 patients, the addition of FFR-CT was safe with no difference in 90-day MACE compared with CCTA alone (42). No deaths or MI occurred among patients with a negative FFR-CT when revascularization was deferred. 6. CCTA is highly effective at ruling out the presence of plaque or stenosis and may help to clarify risk JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al.

Patients with acute chest pain who have indeterminate stenosis on CCTA may beneﬁt from having a stress test with imaging to evaluate for myocardial ischemia (37-43). 4.1.2.1.1. Cost-Value Considerations Economic evaluations have explored the value of stress echocardiography, CCTA, an d stress nuclear imaging. Several observational series report that prompt stress echocardiography in the ED for the evaluation of acute chest pain is associated with signi ﬁcantly lower costs, with no adverse sequelae after early discharge (1,2). In a single-center randomized trial of 400 patients, prompt stress echocardiography was associated with a reduced rate of hospitalization (p¼0.026) and length of stay in the ED (p<0.0001) ( 3). The CT-STAT (Systematic Triage of Acute Chest Pain Patients to Treatment) trial reported on the use of CCTA (n¼361 patients) compared with stress MPI (n¼338 patients) in the acute evaluation of chest pain in the ED (4) .I nt h eC T - S T A Tt r i a l ,t h et i m et od i a g n o s i s was 2.9 hours in the CCTA arm and 6.2 hours in the stress MPI arm (p <0.0001). Accordingly, median adjusted ED charges were nearly 40% lower for CCTA, compared with stress MPI ($2,137 for CCTA versus $3,458 for stress MPI; p<0.001). Overall, CCTA resulted in improved ef ﬁciency with a reduction in length of stay and prompt discharge (5,6), resulting in cost savings from 15% to 38% when c o m p a r e dw i t hs t a n d a r dc a r es t r a t e g i e s(4,7)a n da weighted cost savings of $680 (8). 4.1.2.2. Intermediate-Risk Patients With Acute Chest Pain and Known CAD Recommendations for Intermediate-Risk Patients With Acute Chest Pain and Known CAD Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 16 and 17. COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1A 1. For intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain who have known CAD and present with new onset or worsening symptoms, GDMT should be optimized before additional cardiac testing is performed (1,2). 1A 2. For intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain who have worsening frequency of symptoms with signi ﬁcant left main, proximal left anterior descending stenosis, or multivessel CAD on prior anatomic testing or history of prior coronary revascularization, ICA is recommended (3-8). 2a B-NR 3. For intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain and known nonobstructive CAD, CCTA can be useful to determine progression of atherosc lerotic plaque and obstructive CAD (9-11). 2a B-NR 4. For intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain and coronary artery stenosis of 40% to 90% in a proximal or middle segment on CCTA, FFR-CTis reasonable for diagnosis of vessel-speciﬁc ischemia and to guide decision-making regarding t he use of coronary revascularization (12-17 ). 2a B-NR 5. For intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain and known CAD who have new onset or worsening symptoms, stress imaging (PET/SPECT MPI, CMR, or stress echocardiography) is reasonable (18-21 ). Synopsis Figure 10 includes the evaluation algorithm for patients with known CAD, including patients with nonobstructive and obstructive CAD. In patents with known non- obstructive CAD (i.e., a luminal stenosis 1% to 49% on CCTA or ICA or calciﬁed plaque on chest CT), repeat CCTA is recommended unless there is a large enough plaque burden where ischemia is suspected. The use of FFR-CT may be helpful to guide clin ical decision-making regarding the use of coronary revascularization ( 16). For all other patients with known CAD, stress testing is rec- ommended to guide decisio ns on optimizing medical management and revascularization. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. As shown in many secondary prevention trials, such as the Veterans Affairs Non-Q-Wave myocardial infarction (VANQUISH), COURAGE and ISCHEMIA, GDMT should be assessed in all patients with known CAD and opti- mized when symptomatic (2,22,23). 2. ICA is an effective means for diagnosing obstructive CAD and guiding the use of coronary revascularization. For the intermediate-risk patients with a previous his- tory of CAD, ICA is reasonable for patients presenting with frequent weekly or daily symptoms or for those already on GDMT as well as those with high-risk CAD (left main or proximal left anterior descending or mul- tivessel CAD). 3. For patients with previous anatomic testing that revealed nonobstructive CAD, CCTA has been shown to effectively document progressive CAD, including more extensive atherosclerotic plaque or the presence of high-risk plaque features or new obstructive stenosis $50% (9-11,24). Patients in this category also Gulati et al. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 2021 Chest Pain Guideline NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 e220 include those patients with a previous CAC scan (or those for whom coronary artery calciﬁcation was noted as an incidentalﬁnding on chest CT) who present to an ED for evaluation of chest pain where concern exists with regard to the extent of noncalci ﬁed plaque and potential for underlying obstructive stenosis. Howev- er, for patients with extensive plaque, a stress test is preferred. 4. Patients with acute chest pain who have coronary ar- tery stenosis from 40% to 90% on CCTA may beneﬁt from measurement of FFR-CT, especially when the stenosis is proximal or mid-coronary artery (12-17 ,25). From 1 large clinical registry, the deferral of coronary revascularization with a normal FFR-CT was safe, with n od i f f e r e n c ei nM A C Ea t9 0d a y s(16). 5. Most randomized trials that examined the role of stress testing in the ED enrolled patients with no known CAD, with few including patients with obstructive CAD (range: 7% –15%) ( 18-20 ). Despite this, assessing the functional signi ﬁcance of obstructive CAD is an important part of ischemia- guided management ( 26). FIGURE 10 Evaluation Algorithm for Patients With Suspected ACS at Intermediate Risk With Known CAD Test choice should be guided by local availability and expertise. *Known CAD is prior MI, revascularization, known obstructive or nonobstructive CAD on invasive or CCTA. †If extensive plaque is present a high-quality CCTA is unlikely to be achieved, and stress testing is preferred‡Obstructive CAD includes prior coronary artery bypass graft/percutaneous coronary intervention. §High-risk CAD means left main stenosis$50%; anatomically signiﬁcant 3-vessel disease ($70% stenosis).kFFR-CT turnaround times may impact prompt clinical care decisions.

High-Risk Patients With Acute Chest Pain Synopsis Patients with symptoms suggestive of ACS who are at high risk of short-term MACE include those with new ischemic changes on the ECG, troponin-con ﬁrmed acute myocardial injury, new-onset left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction <40%), newly diagnosed moderate-severe ischemia on stress imaging, and/or a high risk score on CDP (4,13,14). ICA is indicated for pa- tients with con ﬁrmed ACS based on a robust body of randomized trial evidence and clinical practice guideline indications ( 4-7). In the patients with a negative initial evaluation, ICA is also indicated for those categorized as high risk on a validated risk stratiﬁcation instrument. For high-risk patients with a documented AMI on the index ED evaluation and who demonstrate on CCTA or ICA normal or nonobstructive CAD, CMR and echocardi- ography are useful for examining alternative causes for symptoms such as nonischemic cardiomyopathy or myocarditis (8-11). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS are considered at high risk for short-term MACE if they have new ischemic changes on electrocardiography, troponin-con ﬁrmed acute myocardial injury, new- onset left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction <40%), newly diagnosed moderate-severe ischemia on stress testing, hemodynamic instability, and/or a high CDP risk score. Risk scores are recom- mended in guidelines to facilitate the management of patients who present with ACS (3,15,16). 2. Among patients categorized as high risk, ICA provides a comprehensive assessment of the extent and severity of obstructive CAD. Moreover, the determination of the severity of anatomic CAD is critical to guide the use of coronary revascularization (6). 3. Approximately 6% to 15% of troponin-positive ACS occurs in the absence of obstructive CAD ( 17,18). Additional testing may be helpful to identify the cause that may alter an ensuing therapeutic strategy ( 19). Evidence supports that CMR can identify wall motion abnormalities and myocardial edema and distinguish infarct-related scar from non-CAD causes such as myocarditis and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. When performed within 2 weeks of ACS, CMR can be useful to identify MI with nonobstructive CAD (MINOCA) from other causes (8-11).

Acute Chest Pain in Patients With Prior Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Synopsis There are many potential causes of acute chest pain in the months after CABG. M usculoskeletal pain from sternotomy remains the most common. However, other causes such as myocardial ischemia from acute graft stenosis or occlusion ( 1,2), pericarditis, PE, sternal wound infection, or nonunion should also be consid- ered. Post-sternotomy pain syndrome is de ﬁned as discomfort after thoracic surgery, persisting for at least 2 months, and without apparent cause ( 15). The inci- dence of post-sternotomy pain syndrome has been found to be as low as 7% and as high as 66% ( 16-19 ), with a higher prevalence in women compared with men within the ﬁrst 3 months of thoracic surgery (51.4% versus 31.3%; p<0.01) but, after 3 months, postoperative sex difference in prevalence was not seen ( 20). Graft failure within the ﬁrst year post-CABG using saphenous venous grafts is usually a result of technical issues, intimal hyperplasia, or thrombosis ( 5). Internal mam- mary artery graft failure within the ﬁrst-year post-CABG is most commonly attributable to issues with the anas- tomotic site of the graft. Reasons for acute chest pain several years after CABG include either graft stenosis or occlusion or progression of disease in a non-bypassed vessel. One year after CABG, w10% to 20% of saphenous vein grafts fail, while by 10 years, only about half of saphenous vein grafts are patent (5). In contrast, the internalmammary artery has patency rates of 90% to 95% 10 to 15 years after CABG ( 6). Compared with the use of saphenous vein grafts, the use of radial artery grafts for CABG also resulted in a higher rate of patency at 5 years of follow-up ( 7). In addition, knowledge of the native coronary anatomy and type of revascularization (complete o r incomplete) is useful for interpretation of functional testing. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Acute chest pain in patients with prior CABG may be caused by myocardial ischemia as a result of technical errors at the graft anastomotic site, thrombosis within the graft, graft intimal h yperplasia, or vasospasm within arterial grafts. Pro gressive atherosclerosis within bypass grafts or the native coronary vessels may also result in acute chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia. Noninvasive stress imaging testing is reasonable in these patients as stress imaging will identify ischemic myocardial territories that will further guide revascularization for patients who are amenable to and are candidates for revascularization. CCTA has a great degree of accuracy with a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of detecting complete graft occlusions, 99% and 99%, respectively, when compared with the standard of ICA (21). Furthermore, CCTA was ideal in assessing bypass grafts because of the large size of these vessels, decreased vessel calci ﬁcation, and decreased motion of these vessels when compared with native coronary vessels. Evaluation of bypass grafts has been shown to be successful in 93% to 100% of patients (21). In patients who have acute chest pain without features of ACS, CCTA is especially useful for assessing graft patency and is less robust for assessing native coronary vessel stenosis in this population (1-7). 2. There are clinical features and stress imaging test fea- tures in patients with prior CABG presenting with acute chest pain with no ACS that may indicate a high like- lihood of severe ischemic heart disease such as new resting left ventricular systolic dysfunction (left ven- tricular ejection fraction <35%) not readily explained by noncoronary causes, stress electrocardiographic ﬁndings including 2 mm of ST-segment depression at low workload or persisting into recovery, exercise- induced ST-segment elevati on, or exercise-induced VT/ventricular ﬁ brillation (VF), severe stress-induced left ventricular systolic dysfunction, stress-induced perfusion abnormalities involving $10% of the myocardium, or stress-induced left ventricular dila- tion. In those with prior CABG with high-risk stress imaging features, referral for ICA is useful provided that these patients are amenable to, and are candidates for, coronary revascularization ( 8-14). Patients with prior CABG presenting with acute chest pain without t h ep r e s e n c eo fA C Sm a yh a v es t r e s si m a g i n gf e a t u r e s that are equivocal or nondiagnostic for the presence of myocardial ischemia.

In patients with prior CABG surgery presenting with acute chest pain who do not have ACS, performing stress imaging is effective to evaluate for myocardial ischemia or CCTA for graft stenosis or occlusion (1-7). 1 C-LD 2. In patients with prior CABG surgery presenting with acute chest pain, who do not have ACS (8-14)o rw h o have an indeterminate/nondiagnostic stress test, ICA is useful (8). JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al. NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 2021 Chest Pain Guideline e223 imaging may be as a result of patient’s body habitus, inadequate or suboptimal heart rate, arrhythmias such as atrial ﬁbrillation, left bundle branch block, or patient motion. In these patients, performing an ICA is reasonable when the angiographic ﬁndings have a high likelihood of impacting therapeutic decisions (8). 4.1.5. Evaluation of Patients With Acute Chest Pain Receiving Dialysis Recommendation for Evaluation of Patients With Acute Chest Pain Receiving Dialysis Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in Online Data Supplement 20 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 B-NR 1. In patients who experience acute unremitting chestpain while undergoing dialysis, transfer by EMS to an acute care setting is recommended (1-5). Synopsis In 2015, there were nearly 500,000 people in the United States who received maintenance dialysis to treat end-stage renal disease (1). Chest pain occurs during hemodialysis in 2% to 5% of patients (6,7). Causes are numerous and related to the high prevalence of severe cardiovascular disease in this population and the dialysis procedure itself. Causes include AMI or ACS, pericarditis, PE, pleuritis, hemolysis, gastro- esophageal reﬂux, subclavian steal, and musculoskeletal dis- orders (7). Myocardial ischemia is the most frequent serious cause and can be induced by hypotension (6,7) or tachyar- rhythmias (2) occurring during dialysis in patients with CAD. AMI in patients undergoing dialysis is less frequently associ- ated with chest pain than in patients who are not on dialysis, but warning signs may include diaphoresis or dyspnea (3). Unusual but serious causes of chest pain during dialysis are embolism (6) and vessel perforation by catheter (4,5). When indicated, cardiac testing for patients on dialysis should be the same as those who are not on dialysis. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Because the risk of CAD is relatively high in patients undergoing dialysis, when acute unremitting chest pain occurs during dialysis, a 12-lead ECG should be per- formed and the patient should be urgently transferred by EMS to an acute care setting for evaluation for cause of symptoms and further clinical engagement (3). 4.1.6. Evaluation of Acute Chest Pain in Patients With Cocaine and Methamphetamine Use Recommendation for Evaluation of Acute Chest Pain in Patients With Cocaine and Methamphetamine Use Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in Online Data Supplement 21 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 2a B-NR 1. In patients presenting with acute chest pain, it is reasonable to consider cocaine and methamphetamine use as a cause of their symptoms (1-3). Synopsis T h em o s tf r e q u e n tp r e s e n t i n gc o m p l a i n to fc o c a i n e abuse is acute chest pain, resulting from $1o ft h ea l k a - loid’s many cardiovascular actions ( 1,4,5). Cocaine pro- duces a hyperadrenergic state by blocking neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine. The accumu- lation of these catecholamines increases heart rate and blood pressure, sometimes dramatically. These actions and the drug’s simultaneous effect of coronary vasocon- striction and elevated myocardial oxygen demand can produce myocardial ischemia and even infarction in the absence of obstructive CAD. Additional hazardous actions include increased myocardial contractility, cardiac ar- rhythmias, myocardial toxicity directly or through augmented adrenergic stimulation, increased platelet aggregability, endothelial dysfunction, and hypertensive vascular catastrophes (aortic dissection, cerebrovascular hemorrhage) (4-6). Methamphetamine has also been shown to lead to myocardial ischemia from mechanisms similar to cocaine. Studies have shown that methamphetamine can result in d e c r e a s e dm y o c a r d i a lp e r f u s i o n .L i k ec o c a i n e ,m e t h a m - phetamine also may reduce coronary sinus bloodﬂow (7). It has been reported that up to 70% of methamphetamine users have an abnormal ECG, with the most common ﬁnding being tachycardia (8). Additional abnormalities on the ECG have been attributed to presence of hypertension, pulmonary artery hypertension, and cardiomyopathy, all of which have been associated with methamphetamine use (9). General principles for risk stratiﬁcation of patients with chest pain apply to patients with cocaine or meth- amphetamine use (4). Gulati et al. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 2021 Chest Pain Guideline NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 e224 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Cocaine and methamphetamine use can be considered in young patients presenting with chest pain and evi- dence of ACS; the frequency of ACS is <10% among cocaine and methamphetamine users in most studies, and death is rare (1-4). A person’s urine typically tests positive for cocaine or methamphetamine within 1 to 4 hours of consuming the drug and will continue to test positive for 2 to 4 days. 4.1.7. Shared Decision-Making in Patients With Acute Chest Pain Recommendations for Shared Decision-Making in Patients With Acute Chest Pain Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 22 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-R 1. For patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS who are deemed low risk by a CDP, patient decision aids are beneﬁcial to improve understanding and effectively facilitate risk communication ( 1,2). 1 B-R 2. For patients with acute chest pain and suspected ACS who are deemed intermediate risk by a CDP, shared decision-making between the clinician and patient r egarding the need for admission, for observation, discharge, or further evaluation in an outpatient setting is recommended for improving patient under- standing and reducing low-value testing (1,2). Synopsis Risk communication and shared decision-making using a decision aid such asChest Pain Choice have been shown to increase patient knowledge, engagement, and satis- faction and decrease the rate of observation unit admis- sion and 30-day cardiac stress testing in both single-center and multicenter randomized trials ( 1-3). For low-risk pa- tients, decision aids can facilitate risk communication between the clinician and the patient and increase pa- tients ’ understanding of their risk and the importance of outpatient follow-up after discharge from the ED. For intermediate-risk patients, admission to an observation unit or discharge from the ED with further, timely evalu- ation in an outpatient setting is acceptable. Decision aids such as Chest Pain Choice can effectively facilitate shared decision-making regarding the need for admission, observation, or discharge for further evaluation in an outpatient setting (3). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Adult ED patients with acute chest pain who are deemed low risk are frequent ly admitted for observa- tion and cardiac stress testing or CCTA, resulting in increased cost to the patient and the health care system (2). Shared decision-making is the process by which patients and clinicians share information and take steps to build consensus about preferred tests and treat- ments. In shared decision-making, both parties share information: the clinician offers options and describes the potential harms and beneﬁts, and the patient com- municates his or her preferences. Patients are prepared with a better understanding of the relevant factors inﬂuencing the decision and share responsibility for deciding how to proceed. Shared decision-making rests on the principles of patient centered care, including respect for patient autonomy (i.e., that a patient ’s informed preferences should be the basis for medical action) ( 4). Decision aids are patient-centered tools designed to facilitate shared decision-making between a patient and the clinician such that patients ’ values and preferences are incorporated into health care de- cisions ( 5). Shared decision-making, however, can be performed without a decision aid; lack of a decision aid s h o u l dn o tp r e c l u d ea t t e m p t sa ts h a r e dd e c i s i o n - making. 2. In a single-center randomized trial of adults presenting to the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain (n¼204) who were being considered by the treating clinician for admission to the observation unit for cardiac stress testing, patients randomized to shared decision- making facilitated by the Chest Pain Choice Decision Aid (2,3) had greater knowledge, were more engaged in the decision-making process, and less frequently decided to be admitted to the observation unit for stress testing (58% versus 77%, absolute difference 19%, 95% CI: 6%-31%) (2). There were no MACE after discharge in either group. The decision aid was subse- quently tested in a population of 898 patients with greater socioeconomic diversity recruited from 6 EDs across the United States ( 1,6). Similar ﬁndings were observed. Analysis of health care use in this trial showed fewer cardiac imaging tests and lower overall 45-day health care use in patients randomized to the decision aid (7,8).

Evaluation of Acute Chest Pain With Nonischemic Cardiac Pathologies Synopsis Alternative nonischemic causes for acute chest pain should be considered if an ischemic cause is not suspected based on initial evaluation. Echocardiography, as a portable bedside noninvasive and almost universally available tool, should be used to unmask some imminently dangerous but potentially treatable cardiac conditions. TTE is the primary tool to diagnose pericardial effu- sions with and without tamponade, aortic dissections (TTE and transesophageal echocardiography [TEE]), acute right ventricular dysfunction in the setting of PE, as well as mechanical complications of MI (ventricular septal rupture, free wall rupture, pa pillary muscle dysfunction and rupture). Echocardiography can also identify cardiac masses, emboli, or clots in transit, intracardiac shunting, or endocarditis. Furthermore, beyond the anatomic ﬁnd- ings, echocardiography can be used to noninvasively assess volume status, pulmonary hypertension, valvular stenosis, and regurgitation. Many of these entities may present with acute chest pain as well as shortness of breath. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Prompt use of TTE allows for an evaluation of cardiac cause for symptoms and evaluation of alternative pa- thologies for acute chest pain (1-6). Rapid echocardio- graphic assessment may facilitate imaging of the patient while symptomatic. 4.2.1. Acute Chest Pain With Suspected Acute Aortic Syndrome Recommendation for Evaluation of Acute Ches t Pain With Nonischemic Cardiac Pathologies COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 C-EO 1. In patients with acute chest painin whom other potentially life-threatening nonischemic cardiac condi- tions are suspected (e.g., aortic pathology, pericar dial effusion, endocarditis), TTE is recommended for diagnosis. Recommendations for Acute Chest Pain With Suspected Acute Aortic Syndrome COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 C-EO 1. In patients with acute chest pain where there is clinical concern for aortic dissection, computed to- mography angiography (CTA) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is recommended for diagnosis and treatment planning. 1 C-EO 2. In patients with acute chest pain where there is clinical concern for aortic dissection, TEE or CMR should be performed to make the diagnosis if CT is contraindicated or unavailable. Synopsis Acute aortic syndrome describes diseases involving disruptions in the aortic wall, including aortic dissec- tion, intramural hematoma, an d penetrating aortic ulcer (1). The annual incidence is 2 to 4 cases/100,000, with higher prevalence with gene tic conditions that weaken the aortic wall ( 2). Prominent risk factors include hy- pertension athero sclerosis and connective tissue dis- ease. Cocaine use may provoke dissection even without other risk factors. Acute onset of severe chest or back pain heralds acute aortic dissection in 80% to 9 0% of patients, sometimes characterized as ripping or tearing ( 3). Progression can produce end-organ hypoperfusion, and proximal extension may cause tamponade, severe acute aortic regurgitation, or rarely, STEMI. Intramural hematomas, which differ from dissection by absence of an identiﬁable intimal ﬂap, have a lesser understood natural history but are typically evalu- ated and treated in a similar manner to dissections. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. A high index of suspicion in appropriate patients, and a coordinated, multidisciplinary evaluation is needed to optimize outcomes. The diagnostic modality of choice in stable patients is CTA, which is both highly sensitive and speci ﬁc( 4-6). Chest radiographs can show medi- astinal widening but may be normal. 2. TTE can show pericardial effusion or aortic regurgita- tion, and a dissectionﬂap can sometimes be visualized; however, more complete imaging of the aortic arch requires TEE or CT. CMR is sensitive and speciﬁc, but CT is usually more expeditious. Gulati et al. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 2021 Chest Pain Guideline NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 e226 4.2.2. Acute Chest Pain With Suspected PE Synopsis The incidence of PE is estimated at 65 cases per 100,000, but some cases are asymptomatic and others undiagnosed (5,6). One-third of deaths are sudden, and 60% are undiagnosed before death (7). Risk factors for PE are the same for venous thromboembolism and include inherited hypercoagulable states and acquired risk factors (recent surgery, trauma, immobilization, malignancy, smoking, obesity, oral contraception). Recognition of PE can be challenging because symptoms and clinical signs may be nonspeciﬁc. Dyspnea followed by chest pain, classically pleuritic, is the most common presenting symptom ( 1). Signs of deep venous thrombosis may be present on examination (5). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. CTA using PE protocol is the diagnostic modality of choice in stable patients; ventilation-perfusion scan- ning is a second-line alternative in the acute setting (3,4). Use of clinical prediction rules to select patients for imaging can decrease radiation exposure and cost (8). Troponin (and brain natriuretic peptide) can be elevated, and echocardiogr aphy may reveal acute right ventricular strain consequent to large PEs; troponin and brain natriuretic peptide are both markers for higher mortality rate (2). 2. Recognition of PE is important because prompt anti- coagulation improves outcomes (2). Clinical assessment combined with pretest risk stratiﬁcation can help select patients appropriate for diagnostic imaging. In the absence of shock, diagnostic evaluation depends on the clinical assessment of pretest probability ( 3). Several prediction rules are available that add predictive value to clinical assessment (4). D-dimers are highly sensitive but not very speciﬁc for the diagnosis of PE in ED pa- tients. Measurement of D-dimers, using age- and sex- speci ﬁc cutoffs, may be useful in patients at low to in- termediate pretest probability; those with negative D- dimers can probably be discharged without further testing, whereas those with positive values should be considered for CTA (2). 4.2.3. Acute Chest Pain With Suspected Myopericarditis Recommendations for Acute Chest Pain With Suspected PE Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 23 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. In stable patients with acute chest pain with highclinical suspicion for PE, CTA using a PE protocol is recommended ( 1-4). 1 C-EO 2. For patients with acute chest pain and possible PE, need for further testing should be guided by pretest probability. Recommendations for Acute Chest Pain With Suspected Myopericarditis Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 24 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. In patients with acute chest pain and myocardial injury who have nonobstructive coronary arteries on anatomic testing, CMR with gadolinium contrast is effective to distinguish myopericarditis from other causes, including myocardial infarction an d nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) ( 1-6). 1 B-NR 2. In patients with acute chest pain with suspected acutemyopericarditis, CMR is useful if there is diagnostic uncertainty, or to determine the presence and extent of myocardial and pericardial inﬂammation and ﬁbrosis (7-12). 1 C-EO 3. In patients with acute chest pain and suspected myopericarditis, TTE is effective to determine the presence of ventricular wall motion abnormalities , pericardial effusion, valvular abnormalities, or restrictive physiology. 2b C-LD 4. In patients with acute chest pain with suspected acute pericarditis, noncontrast or contrast cardiac CT scanning may be reasonable to determine the presence and degree of pericardial thickening (7,8,13). JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al. NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 2021 Chest Pain Guideline e227 Synopsis Pericarditis and myocarditis share overlapping com- mon causes and likely form a continuum (8). In patients with pericarditis, a minimally elevated troponin does not appear to confer a worse prognosis ( 14). Most cases of pericarditis in developed nations are viral, although tuberculosis is sometimes a consideration. Pericarditis classically presents with chest pain that is sharp, pleuritic, and which may be improved by sitting up or leaning forward, although in many instances such ﬁndings are not present. A pericardial friction rub may be audible. Widespread ST-elevation with PR depression is the electrocardiographic hallmark, although changes are nonspeci ﬁc and may be transient. Clinical manifestations of myocarditis are varied and include chest pain that is often sharp and re ﬂective of epicardial in ﬂammation involving the pericardium. Myocardial dysfunction often causes fatigue and exercise intolerance, and predomina nce of heart failure distin- guishes myocarditis from pericarditis. Troponin is usually elevated (15). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. CMR with late gadolinium enhancement imaging can show characteristic changes of acute myopericarditis, especially if performed early, within 2 weeks of the index presentation. CMR can also frequently distin- guish between acute myopericarditis, other cardiomy- opathies, and occult MI and other causes of MI and nonobstructive coronary arteries ( 1,2). 2. In patients with suspected acute myopericarditis, or if there is diagnostic uncertainty, CMR is useful to determine myocardial edema, thickening, and late enhancement. CMR may also show evidence of peri- cardial effusions (2,16). CMR has a sensitivity of 94% to 100% in detecting in ﬂammation of the pericardium (7-10). CMR features that are suggestive of acute peri- carditis include enhanceme nt or thickened pericar- dium, although such ﬁndings can also be seen in the presence of pericardial ﬁbrosis. In addition, increased signal on T2-weighted images correlates with edema, which may be seen in acute myopericarditis. The presence of pericardial adhesions between the visceral and parietal pericardium may be useful in patients with suspected acute pericarditis or pericardial constriction ( 7-10). 3. In patients with suspected myopericarditis, echocar- diography may show segmen tal left ventricular wall hypokinesis, which suggests myocardial involvement in patients with myocarditis and is, therefore, a useful tool in these patients. Patients with acute pericarditis may also have echocardiographic ﬁndings such as increased pericardial brightness or pericardial effusion with or without tamponade physiology. Some patients with acute pericarditis may also have normal echocar- diographic ﬁndings (9,17). 4. In patients with suspected acute pericarditis, cardiac CT with or without contrast may show features that are suggestive of acute pericarditis, such as pericardial thickening or enhancement (after contrast administra- tion). Additionally, CT attenuation values of pericardial effusion can help distinguish between exudative and transudative pericardial ﬂuid. There are limited data on the accuracy of cardiac CT in diagnosing acute pericar- ditis; a small study showed that pericardial thickening or enhancement was the most accurate single parameter for pericarditis, with sensitivity of 54% to 59% and speci ﬁcity of 91% to 96%. Therefore, cardiac CT is a reasonable second-line study in these patients (7,8,13). 4.2.4. Acute Chest Pain With Valvular Heart Disease (VHD) Recommendations for Acute Chest Pain With VHD COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 C-EO 1. In patients presenting with acute chest pain with suspected or known history of VHD, TTE is useful in determining the presence, severity, and cause of VHD. 1 C-EO 2. In patients presenting with acute chest pain with suspected or known VHD in whom TTE diagnostic quality is inadequate, TEE (with 3D imaging if available) is useful in determining the severity and cause of VHD. 2a C-EO 3. In patients presenting with acute chest pain withknown or suspected VHD, CMR imaging is reasonable as an alternative to TTE and/or TEE is nondiagnostic. Gulati et al. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 2021 Chest Pain Guideline NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 e228 Synopsis Chest pain may occur in the presence of VHD, partic- ularly stenotic VHD such as aortic valve stenosis and mitral valve stenosis with secondary pulmonary hyper- tension. Chest pain may also occur after papillary muscle r u p t u r ei nt h es e t t i n go fM Io ri na c u t ed e g e n e r a t i v e mitral valve disease after spo ntaneous chordal rupture. Chest pain may also occur in the setting of acute severe aortic insufﬁciency, which may be related to acute aortic pathology such as an aortic dissection manifesting as se- vere acute chest pain that may radiate to the back. The cause of chest pain in patients with aortic valve stenosis may be secondary to coexisting obstructive epicardial CAD ( 1) or, more commonly, chest pain may occur as a result of coronary microvascular dysfunction (2) in the presence of very elevated left ventricular pres- sure caused by a high left ventricular afterload, along with the associated left ventricular hypertrophy. The cause of chest pain in patients with severe mitral valve stenosis is more likely to be secondary to epicardial obstructive CAD (1) although, less likely, chest pain may occur in isolated mitral valve stenosis resulting from low cardiac output and decreased coronary perfusion (1). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Patients with VHD may present with chest pain particularly in the setting of stenotic VHD, severe valvular regurgitation in the setting of AMI with ruptured papillary muscle resulting in acute severe mitral valve insufﬁciency, or acute aortic valve insuf- ﬁciency in the setting of acute aortic pathology, such as aortic dissection ( 3,4). TTE is useful in assessing valvular pathologies because it is widely available and is therefore a good ﬁrst-line test in these patients to determine the presence, severity, and cause of VHD (3). 2. The ability to attain adequate 3-dimensional (3D) transthoracic images depends on the ability to obtain adequate 2-dimensional images ( 5). In these clinical situations where TTE images are technically inade- quate, TEE with 3D images, if required, is useful to determine the severity and cause of VHD (3,6). 3. There may be clinical situations when TTE and TEE may not be technically adequate to assess the severity and cause of VHD. In such circumstances, CMR may be useful to objectively assess the severity and cause of VHD (6). The aorta can also be visualized on CMR and can therefore be used to assess acute aortic pathologies accompanying aortic valve insuf ﬁciency such as aortic dissection (4). 4.3. Evaluation of Acute Chest Pain With Suspected Noncardiac Causes Recommendation for Evaluation of Acute Chest Pain With Suspected Noncardiac Causes COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 C-EO 1. Patients with acute chest pain should be evaluated for noncardiac causes if they have persistent or recurring symptoms despite a negative stress test or anatomic cardiac evaluation, or a low-risk desig- nation by a CDP. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al. NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 2021 Chest Pain Guideline e229 Synopsis The differential diagnosis for noncardiac causes of acute chest pain is quite broad and includes respiratory, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, psychological, and other causes (Table 9). Of these, musculoskeletal causes are the most common, including costochondritis, muscle strain, and potential consequences of recent or occult chest trauma such as rib fracture. Various gastrointestinal causes, commonly esophageal, can present with chest pain, including ga strointestinal re ﬂux and esophageal dysmotility as well as gastritis from either medications or peptic ulcer disease. Respiratory causes are less frequent but potentially more serious and include PE, pneumonia, and pneumothorax. Many patients will have dyspnea in addition to chest pain. Psychological causes are usually diagnoses of exclusion but merit consideration in the right context. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. If acute myocardial injury is ruled out, alternative diagnoses merit consideration in patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms. Clinical risk assessment, with implementation of CDPs when appropriate, is the key to selecting patients for further diagnostic evaluation and also to choosing among potential diagnostic modalities.

Evaluation of Acute Chest Pain With Suspected Gastrointestinal Syndromes Synopsis Among outpatients who present with chest pain, approxi- mately 10% to 20% have a gastrointestinal cause (1). Gastroin- testinal pain may result from stimulation of chemoreceptors by acid or hyperosmolar substances, of mechanoreceptors by abnormal contraction or distention, or of thermoreceptors (2). Some patients have abnormal perceptions of otherwise normal stimuli. Gastroesophageal reﬂux disease is the most likely cause for recurring unexplained chest pain of esophageal origin (3). Chest pain caused by gastroesophageal reﬂux disease can mimic myocardial ischemia and may be described as squeezing or burning. The duration can be minutes to hours, often occurs after meals or at night, and can worsen with stress. Depending on the severity, it may or may not resolve spontaneously or with antacids. Esophagitis not related to reﬂux may be caused by medications, underlying infections such as candidiasis, or radiation injury. Allergic conditions are associated with eosin- ophilic esophagitis, which is diagnosed by biopsy. Esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia, distal esophageal spasm, and nutcracker esophagus are less common but can present as squeezing retrosternal pain or spasm, often accompanied by dysphagia. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. The ﬁr s ts t e pi ne v a l u a t i o no fp o t e n t i a le s o p h a g e a l chest pain is a careful histo ry. Although the clinical presentation often does not provide adequate clues to distinguish cardiac from esophageal pain, some symp- toms may be suggestive of an esophageal cause, such as heartburn, regurgitation, or dysphagia, and relief with antacid or antisecretory agents. These symptoms, however, are not sufﬁciently speci ﬁc to be fully diag- nostic. A history of use of medications such as nonsteroidal anti-in ﬂammatory agents, potassium supplements, iron, or bisphosphonates should be sought. Physical examination is often unrevealing. When an esophageal cause of chest pain is suspected, upper endoscopy should be considered (4). Symptoms and signs that merit early evaluation (usually within 2 weeks) include dysphagia, o dynophagia, gastrointes- tinal bleeding, unexplained iron de ﬁciency anemia, weight loss, and recurrent vomiting. Patients without these symptoms may merit a trial of empiric acid sup- pression therapy ( 5). If an upper endoscopy is normal and the symptoms persist despite a trial of acid sup- pression, consideration should be given to additional evaluation, such as esophageal function testing and pH monitoring, to exclude other esophageal causes (6). 4.3.2.

Synopsis Although the heart-brain relationship is well estab- lished (15-17 ), its clinical relevance has been enhanced by recognition of stress cardiomyopathy ( 18,19). Less dra- matic than the latter syndrome but highly prevalent is recurrent chest pain despite angiographically normal cor- onary arteries and no deﬁnable cardiac disease, including an assessment for INOCA ( 1-14) .C h e s tp a i ni nt h e s ep a - tients has been variously labeled angina, angina-like, “atypical ” angina, or noncardiac chest pain based on its deviation from characteristic ischemic cardiac discomfort. Prognosis of patients with noncardiac chest pain is largely devoid of cardiac complications (4,9,20-23 ). The close as- sociation of this symptom with psychological syndromes JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al. NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 2021 Chest Pain Guideline e231 such as anxiety, panic attack, depression, somatoform disorder, and cardiophobia suggests that there may be a psychogenic origin in many patients. These factors have also raised consideration of mechanisms for noncardiac chest pain such as central nervous system-visceral in- teractions, low pain thresholds, hyperbody vigilance, sympathetic activation, as w e l la sa n x i e t y ,d e p r e s s i o n , and panic disorder (6,7,9,14,23-30 ). It has been reported that these patients undergo extensive and repetitive cardiac testing and have low referral to cognitive- behavioral therapists, suggesting a lost opportunity for pharmacologic or cognitive-behavioral therapy ( 6). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Most low-risk patients presenting to the ED or of ﬁce setting with chest pain do not have life-threatening conditions. Diagnoses may include psychological en- tities such as somatization or noncardiac chest pain (1- 13). It has been reported that in low-risk chest pain pa- tients without evidence of cardiac disease, depression, anxiety, and gastroesophageal syndromes each excee- ded CAD by almost 10-fold ( 7). Additionally, care of these patients often includes multiple tests, high cost, and avoidable radiation exposure (5.0 mSv) (6). A low rate ( <10%) of clinician inquiry, documentation, or referral has also been noted for psychological factors, even in chest pain patients with self-reported anxiety (6,7). A systematic review of therapy for patients with chest pain, no evidence of cardiac disease, and psy- chological disorders revealed that antidepressants and anxiolytics had mixed evidence for efﬁcacy (10), but a Cochrane database of psychotherapy (17 RCTs) for such patients revealed a 32% reduction in chest pain fre- quency (11) for a 3-month interval. Approaches using cognitive-behavioral methods were most effective ( 11). These results were limited by small study cohorts and patient heterogeneity; however, they do suggest beneﬁt from consideration of psychogenic factors in patients who continue to seekevaluation for chest pain despite previous deﬁnitive, negative workups. 4.3.3. Evaluation of Acute Chest Pain in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease Recommendations for Evaluation of Acute Chest Pain in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 26 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. In patients with sickle cell disease who report acute chest pain, emergency transfer by EMS to an acute care setting is recommended (1-5). 1 C-LD 2. In patients with sickle cell disease who report acute chest pain, ACS should be excluded (3-5). Synopsis Acute chest syndrome is a leading cause of death for patients with sickle cell disease (1,2). Patients with sickle cell disease who are experie ncing chest pain require prompt evaluation (3). Although chest pain occurs in most, other manifestations of acute chest syndrome include shortness of breath, fever, arm and leg pain, and the presence of a new density on chest radiography. Older adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease who pre- sent with chest pain and shortness of breath should be evaluated for AMI or myocardial ischemia (4). AMI occurs in patients with sickle cell disease at a relatively early age, usually without the traditional risk factors for ACS. Death from ACS in patients with sickle cell disease is signi ﬁ- cantly high in age-, sex-, and race-matched controls (5). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In patients with sickle cell disease who experience chest pain, ACS is associated with signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality rates. These patients should be transferred to an acute care setting by EMS when there is clinical suspicion of ACS. 2. The recommended diagnost ic evaluation for all adults with sickle cell disease who have a clinical presentation concerning for acute chest syndrome includes an ECG, troponin test, complete blood count with white blood cell differential, reticulocyte count, anteroposterior and lateral chest radiograph, and blood and sputum cultures. 5. EVALUATION OF PATIENTS WITH STABLE CHEST PAIN 5.1. Patients With No Known CAD Presenting With Stable Chest Pain Stable chest pain is a symptom of myocardial ischemia characterized by chest pain that is provoked with stress (physical or emotional). Risk status in suspected stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) is not well deﬁned. Figure 11 provides a description of SIHD risk estimates (1). Gulati et al. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 2021 Chest Pain Guideline NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 e232 5.1.1. Pretest Risk Probability to Guide Need for Stress and Anatomic Tests In the evaluation of symptomatic patients with suspected CAD, use of validated scores to predict the pretest prob- ability of obstructive CAD may be useful to identify low- risk patients for whom testing may be deferred. It is preferable to use contemporary estimates such as those published in the past 10 years, such as the pretest prob- ability proposed by Juarez-Orozco et al. (1) in preference to scores from historical patient series, which may over- estimate the frequency of obstructive CAD. Alternatively, low-risk patients may be those <40 years of age or who have symptoms that have a low likelihood of representing ischemia (Section 5.1.2 ). When available, information on the presence and amount of CAC may be useful for enhancing the pretest probability of obstructive CAD, as shown in Figure 11 (2). This information can be obtained from performing a CAC scan or, when available, from a visual estimation of CAC based on prior noncardiac chest CT. Among the remaining patients classi ﬁed as intermediate-high risk, selective testing may improve diagnosis of CAD and for risk stratiﬁcation purposes (1-5). 5.1.2. Low-Risk Patients With Stable Chest Pain and No Known CAD FIGURE 11 Pretest Probabilities of Obstructive CAD in Symptomatic Patients According to Age, Sex, and Symptoms Modiﬁed from Juarez-Orozco et al. (1) and Winther et al. (2). 1) The pretest probability shown is for patients with anginal symptoms. Patients with lower-risk symptoms would be expected to have lower pretest probability. 2) The darker green- and orange-shaded regions denote the groups in which noninvasive testing is most beneﬁcial (pretest probability>15%). The light green–shaded regions denote the groups with pretest probability of CAD#15% in which the testing for diagnosis may be considered based on clinical judgment (1). 3) If CAC is available, it can also be used to estimate the pretest probability based on CAC score (2). CAC indicates coronary artery calcium; and CAD, coronary artery disease. Recommendations for Low-Risk Patients With Stable Chest Pain and No Known CAD Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 27 and 28. COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. For patients with stable chest pain and no known CAD presenting to the outpatient clinic, a model to estimate pretest probability of obstructive CAD is effective to identify patients at low risk for obstructive CAD and favorable prognosis in whom additional diagnostic testing can be deferred (1-5). 2a B-R 2. For patients with stable chest pain and no known CAD categorized as low risk, CAC testing is reasonable as aﬁrst-line test for excluding calciﬁed plaque and identifying patients with a low likelihood of obstructive CAD (6-9). 2a B-NR 3. For patients with stable chest pain and no known CADcategorized as low risk, exercise testing without i m a g i n gi sr e a s o n a b l ea saﬁrst-line test for excluding myocardial ischemia and determining functional capacity in patients with an interpretable ECG (10). JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al. NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 2021 Chest Pain Guideline e233 Synopsis Over the past several decades, patient presentation and observed obstructive CAD prevalence has changed, thus affecting patient selection for diagnostic testing. Current observations in the United States include: n Typical exertional angina prevalence is generally low (<10%), with more patients presenting without the classic demand-related symptoms ( 11). Symptoms can be infrequent (i.e., on a weekly or monthly basis) (12,13), which challenges the diagnostic evaluation. n Among patients undergoing a diagnostic evaluation, there is a relatively low prevalence of obstructive CAD and ischemia (i.e., w10%) (11,14,15). n Traditional pretest risk scores largely overestimate disease probability and contribute to overtesting (16-19 ). n Current testing patterns result in a high normal coro- nary angiography rate (upward of 50%–60%) (20,21). For the aforementioned reasons, use of a contemporary pretest probability estimates to de ﬁne low-risk patients not requiring additional diagnostic testing is a primary goal of the initial evaluation of symptomatic patients with suspected CAD ( 5). Even when contemporary pretest probability estimates are used, they have a low speciﬁcity for identifying patients withobstructive CAD. A CAC score of zero can be useful to identify patients with stable chest pain who are low risk, have a low likelihood of obstructive CAD, and a low risk of future cardiovascular events (7). Additionally, exercise testing without imaging is also reasonable to perform in low-risk individuals with stable chest pain and no known CAD to exclude myocardial ischemia and assess functional capacity (10)( Figure 12). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. There are several pretest probability scores for use in symptomatic patients with suspected CAD. Older pre- test probability scores, such as the Diamond-Forrester model developed in 1979, estimates the probability of obstructive CAD, resulting in signiﬁcant overestimation in contemporary patients referred for noninvasive imaging, particularly women ( 1). Newer pretest proba- bility estimates are available (4). The CAD Consortium models include basic (age, sex, symptoms, and hospital setting); clinical (basic model þ risk factors: diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking); and extended (clinical model þ CAC) versions. Each new variant is better than older models, and the addition of variables within each model level improves prediction (3). A major strength of these models is the extensive validation in different hospitals, settings, and countries. Another updated model to estimate the pretest proba- bility of obstructive CAD was recently developed (4,22) and has been recommended by the ESC guidelines, further reinforcing that the prevalence of obstructive CAD among symptomatic patients is substantially lower than predicted estimates. 2. Among symptomatic patients, a CAC score of zero identi ﬁes a low-risk cohort of patients who may not require additional diagnostic testing; most events occur among patients with detectable CAC (e.g., 84% in the PROMISE trial) ( 7,9). Several randomized trials evaluated the role of CAC in guiding selective use of follow-up testing, including CCTA ( 6,7). From the CRESCENT 1 (Comprehensive Cardiac CT Versus Exer- cise Testing in Suspected Coronary Artery Disease) trial, 350 symptomatic patients were randomized to CAC scanning versus exercise ECGs ( 7). Only patients with detectable CAC or high pretest risk (141/242) un- d e r w e n tf o l l o w - u pC C T A .A t1y e a r ,t h eC A Ca r mw a s associated with a reduction in cardiovascular disease events when compared with those who underwent exercise testing alone (p¼0.011). 3. Exercise testing was shown to be an effective diag- nostic strategy in low-risk symptomatic women from the WOMEN (What Is the Optimal Method for Ischemia Evaluation in Women) trial, when compared with exercise MPI ( 10). Using this approach, there was no signiﬁcant difference in CAD death or hospi- talization for an ACS or heart failure, with either test, but exercise testing alone provided signi ﬁcant cost savings.

COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS Index Diagnostic Testing Anatomic Testing 1A 1. For intermediate-high risk patients with stable chest pain and no known CAD, CCTA is effective for diagnosis of CAD, for risk stratiﬁcation, and for guiding treatment decisions (1-12).

For intermediate-high risk patients with stable chest pain and no known CAD,s t r e s si m a g i n g( s t r e s s echocardiography, PET/SPECT MPI or CMR) is effective for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and for estimating risk of MACE (8,13-35 ). 2a B-R 3. For intermediate-high risk patients with stable chest pain and no known CAD for whom rest/stress nu- clear MPI is selected, PET is reasonable in preference to SPECT, if available to improve diagnostic ac- curacy and decrease the rate of nondiagnostic test results (36-39 ). 2a B-R 4. For intermediate-high risk patients with stable chest pain and no known CAD with an interpretable ECG and ability to achieve maximal levels of exercise (‡5 METs), exercise electrocardiography is reasonable (8,13,15,40-45 ). 2b B-NR 5. In intermediate-high risk patients with stable chest pain selected for stress MPI using SPECT, the use of attenuation correction or prone imaging may be reasonable to decrease the rate of false-positiveﬁndings (46-51 ).

In intermediate-high risk patients with stable chest pain who have pathological Q waves, symptoms or signs suggestive of heart failure, complex ventricular arrhythmias, or a heart murmur with unclear diagnosis, use of TTE is effective fordiagnosis of resting left ventricular systolic and diastolic ventricular function and detection of myocardial, valvular, and pericardial abnormalities ( 13,14,52).

For intermediate-high risk patients with stablechest pain and known coronary stenosis of 40% to 90% in a proximal or middle coronary segment on CCTA, FFR-CT can be useful for diagnosis of vessel-speciﬁc ischemia and to guide decision-making regard ing the use of coronary revascularization (12,53-58 ). 2a B-NR 8. For intermediate-high risk patients with stable chest pain after an inconclusive or abnormal exercise ECG or stress imaging study, CCTA is reasonable (5,59-63 ). 2a B-NR 9. For intermediate-high risk patients with stable chest pain and no known CAD undergoing stress testing, the addition of CAC testing can be useful (64-70 ). 2a B-NR 10. For intermediate-high risk patients with stable chest pain after inconclusive CCTA, stress imaging is reasonable ( 13,14,20-23 , 40,71-76 ). 2b C-EO 11. For intermediate-high risk patients with stable chest pain after a negative stress test but with high clinical suspicion of CAD, CCTA or ICA may be reasonable. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al. NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 2021 Chest Pain Guideline e235 Synopsis The approach to the diagnostic evaluation of patients with no known CAD who are at intermediate to high risk (Figure 12) should be guided by the ability to achieve high- quality imaging as well as local availability and expertise. Intermediate-high risk patients have modest rates of obstructive CAD ( w10%–20%) and risk of clinical events (w1%–2% per year) ( 1,5,8,77-80 ). CCTA is preferable in those <65 years of age and not on optimal preventive therapies, while stress testing may be advantageous in those $65 years of age, because they have a higher likeli- hood of ischemia and obstructive CAD ( 34-36 ,81-83 ). Although previous guidelines supported direct referral to ICA among patients with stable chest pain, contemporary randomized trials support that candidates for elective coronary angiography may be safely triaged using CCTA (1,84) or noninvasive stress testing (34,35). Patient characteristics and existing contraindications for a given test modality ( Tables 5 and 6 )s h o u l db e considered when choosing a d iagnostic test. Imaging of obese patients, especially those with morbid obesity (body mass index >40), can be challenging and requires careful consideration of available equipment. In obese patients, contrast enhancement is useful to improve imaging qual- ity. In certain patients, it may be important to undergo exercise testing so to collect data on the hemodynamic or symptomatic response to exercise. In patients selected for stress imaging who are able to exercise, exercise testing is preferred over pharmacologic stress to improve the diag- nostic and prognostic infor mation of the test. Although PET and SPECT are grouped together, PET has improved diagnostic and prognostic p erformance, especially when quantitative assessment of MBF can be performed (36-39 ). Irrespective of the test performed, an overarching goal of the evaluation of symptomatic patients is to identify those who would beneﬁtf r o mG D M T ,a sd eﬁned by the 2014 SIHD guidelines, the 2018 cholesterol-lowering guidelines, and the 2019 prevention guidelines (13,85-87 ). For this evaluation, the patient should be engaged in a process of shared decision-making before determining the ﬁnal choice of the cardiac test modality and in guiding the pathway for treatment decisions. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text Anatomic Testing 1. Clinical trials report a higher diagnostic sensitivity for CCTA compared with stress testing for detecting obstructive CAD on ICA ( 2-4,37,38,88). CCTA without stenosis or plaque has a low CAD event rate. From the PROMISE trial, the 3-year CAD event rate for negative test ﬁ ndings was 0.9% for CCTA versus 2.1% for stress testing (17). Randomized trials comparing the effectiveness of CCTA versus stress testing report similar near-term effectiveness (at w2–3 years of follow-up) (7,8,10-12 ,89). In the SCOT-HEART (Scottish Computed Tomography of the Heart) trial, the addition of CCTA to standard of care resulted in a reduction in 5-year CAD death or AMI when compared with standard care alone (predominantly ex- ercise ECG) (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.41-0.84; p ¼0.004) (9). From a prespeci ﬁed analysis from the PROMISE trial, patients with diabetes who underwent CCTA had a lower risk of cardiovascular deat ho rM Iw h e nc o m p a r e dw i t h those randomized to stress testing (adjusted HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.18-0.79; p ¼0.01) ( 6). Especially for patients with nonobstructive and obstructive CAD, CCTA more often prompts initiation and intensiﬁcation of preventive and anti-ischemic therapies than other diagnostic strate- gies (6,89-96 ). Several randomized trials compared the effectiveness of CCTA versus direct referral to ICA among symptomatic patients ( 1,5). From the CONSERVE trial, a strategy of initial CCTA was associated with lower cost but similar 1-year MACE rates (death, ACS, stroke, urgent/ emergency coronary revascularization, or cardiac hospi- talization) as direct ICA (4.6% versus 4.6%) (5). Stress Testing 2. The prognostic value of st ress echocardiography has been demonstrated in large observational series with low rates of CAD events for patients with normal test results, particularly those with good exercise tolerance (71,72,97-99 ). In the PROMISE trial, patients random- ized to stress testing had nodifference in the primary outcome of death, ACS, or major procedural compli- cations as compared to CCTA (100). For stress nuclear imaging, multicenter registr ies support effective risk strati ﬁcation based on rest/stress measures of MPI and left ventricular function ( 13,21,27,28,98,101,102), with recent evidence on the prognostic value of stress PET (26,37,38,103, 104). Randomized trials have compared the effectiveness of rest/stress MPI with other nonin- vasive tests, such as CMR ( 105)a n dC C T A ,r e v e a l i n g similar 1- to 3-year outcomes. Two multicenter trials have evaluated the effectiveness of a CMR-guided strategy as compared to standard testing approaches (34,35). The CE-MARC 2 multicenter trial (n ¼1,202) revealed that both CMR and SPECT MPI were associ- ated with similar rates (i.e., 7.1%–7.5%) of unnecessary invasive angiography (de ﬁned as a no CAD stenosis $70% or a normal invasive FFR) compared with standard testing for chest pain (28.8%; p<0.001) (34). The MR-INFORM trial r andomized 918 patients with typical angina and multiple risk factors or a pos- itive exercise ECG to a CMR strategy versus invasive FFR strategy ( 35). The CMR strategy was associated with less coronary revascularization (p ¼0.005) and a s i m i l a re v e n tr a t e( d e a t h ,A M I ,o rt a r g e tv e s s e lr e v a s - cularization; p ¼0.91).

Although PET and SPECT are grouped together, PET has improved diagnostic and prognostic perfor- mance, especially when quantitative assessment of MBF can be performed ( 36-39 ). A recent clinical trial (n ¼475) reported a higher diagnostic accuracy with stress PET MPI compared with other stress test modalities ( 38). 4. Diagnostic accuracy of the exercise ECG is lower (i.e., sensitivity and speci ﬁcity range, 60% –77%) than stress imaging, but prognostication remains a useful goal ( 13,41). In the WOMEN trial including 824 symptomatic women, exercise ECG was equally effective when compared with exercise SPECT MPI, with similar 2-year CAD event rates (2.0% versus 2.3%; p¼0.59) (40) .F a i l u r et oc o m p l e t et h eﬁrst stage of the Bruce protocol (or <5M E T s )o rt oa c h i e v e8 5 % of age-predicted ﬁtness level increases CAD event risk (13,41-45 ). Patients exercising to Bruce stage III or >10 METs with a negative ECG have a low risk of CAD events. In patients with submaximal exercise or for those with an ischemic ECG $1.0 mm ST depression, additional stress imaging may improve risk detection and guide clinical management ( 41). Marked ischemia (e.g., $2.0 mm at reduced work- loads) or high Duke or Lauer scores signify increased risk among women and men ( 13,41,42,44); such pa- tients may bene ﬁt from additional testing (anatomic or stress testing). 5. Use of attenuation correction algorithms and prone imaging can reduce MPI artifacts (46-51 ). Assessment of Left Ventricular Function 6. Clinical practice guidelines and appropriate use criteria support use of TTE as appropriate for the assessment of regional and global left ventricular function ( 13,14). The likelihood of abnormal ﬁndings increases when TTE is performed selectively among higher risk pa- tients, such as those with electrocardiographic Q waves or heart failure symptoms, complex ventricular ar- rhythmias, or a heart murmur (52). Sequential or Add-on Testing 6. The use of FFR-CT is supported by several studies (56,57,104), including one reporting improved diag- nostic accuracy with FFR-CT versus coronary CT alone when applying invasive FFR as the gold standard (56). Several multinational regi stries have examined the utility of FFR-CT with regards to guiding clinical decision-making and the safety of deferring coronary revascularization in patients with a negative FFR-CT (12,26,53,54). In the ADVANCE registry, FFR-CT changed treatment recommendations in two-thirds of 5,083 patients, and there were no MACE at 90 days for patients with a negative FFR-CT (54). FFR-CT is most beneﬁcial when measured in a coronary ste- nosis of 40% to 90% severity located in a proximal or mid-coronary artery segment (54,106,107). 7. Use of CCTA after stress testing can diagnose or exclude obstructive CAD and identify patients who may bene ﬁt from referral to ICA ( 5,59-61 ,63). The ISCHEMIA trial used CCTA a fter site-determined moderate-severe ischemia to exclude patients with nonobstructive CAD and id entifying those with sig- niﬁcant left main stenosis who bene ﬁt from prompt referral to ICA (63,108). Half of the screen failures for the ISCHEMIA trial were identiﬁed by CCTA including those with nonobstructive CAD or unprotected left main CAD. 8. Observational registry data suggest that adding CAC can improve risk assessment, reduce diagnostic un- certainty, help detect atherosclerotic plaque, and guide preventive management (64-70 ,94,109,110). 9. After an initial exercise ECG, data support an improved diagnostic accuracy and improved risk strati ﬁcation with further stress imaging, such as with stress echocardiography (13,14,71,72), nuclear MPI (20- 23,40,73-76 ), or CMR (35,111-113 ). 10. For the symptomatic patients with negative stress test ﬁndings, selective use of CCTA or invasive coronary angiography can help detect obstructive CAD and atherosclerotic plaque and reduce diagnostic certainty.

Patients With Known CAD Presenting With Stable Chest Pain Synopsis In patients with known CAD, clinicians should opt to intensify GDMT ﬁrst, if there is an opportunity to do so, and defer testing. Although GDMT exists for obstructive CAD, there are no current guidelines that are speciﬁct o nonobstructive CAD. Thus, adhering to atherosclerotic CV prevention guidelines is recommended (4,5). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines for treatment of patients with stable CAD recommend optimization of anti-ischemic and preventive therapies with the goal to reduce the patient ’s angina burden and improve clin- ical outcomes (6,7). 2. For all patients with a history of CAD risk factors, optimized preventive therapy should be used accord- ing to ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines (4,5). 5.2.1.

NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 2021 Chest Pain Guideline e239 Synopsis In patients with known CAD, physicians should opt to intensify GDMT ﬁrst, if there is an opportunity to do so, and defer testing. In patients with a history of obstructive CAD, previous AMI, or previous coronary revasculariza- tion, assessing the severity of ischemia may be useful to guide clinical decision-making regarding the use of ICA and intensify preventive and anti-ischemic therapy. Im- aging should be considered in those with new onset or persistent stable chest pain ( Figure 13). In patients with frequent angina or severe stress-induced ischemia, referral to ICA or CCTA is an option ( 4). Among in- dividuals with known obstructive CAD or ischemic heart disease who have stable symptoms, exercise treadmill testing may be useful for assessing functional capacity, assessing the type and severity of symptoms, and informing the role of coronary revascularization, cardiac rehabilitation, or anti-anginal therapy ( 4,38-40 ).

SIHD randomized trials reveal a pattern that ischemia- guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) re- s u l t si na ni m p r o v e m e n ti na n g i n aw h e nc o m p a r e d with medical therapy alone (1-4,41). In the ISCHEMIA trial, a total of 5,179 patients with stable CAD and site- determined moderate-severe ischemia on stress testing were randomized to invasive versus conserva- tive care strategies (4). No difference in the composite primary MACE endpoint was observed atw3.3 years of follow-up. Patients presen ting with daily, weekly, or monthly angina had a prompt and durable improve- ment in symptoms when randomized to invasive compared with conservative management (41). 2. Coronary revascularization after identi ﬁcation of sus- pected lesion-speci ﬁci s c h e m i a( F F R#0.80 or instan- taneous wave-free ratio #0.89) in obstructive CAD is associated with improved event-free survival c o m p a r e dw i t ht h eu s eo fP C Id e t e r m i n e db ya n a t o m y alone (3,5,6,42). 3. In a patient presenting with new or recurrent chest pain symptoms, progression of CAD (i.e., new or worsening stenosis or more extensive nonobstructive atherosclerotic plaque) may be characterized using CCTA (43,44). Detection of nonobstructive CAD often results in prompt initiation and intensiﬁcation of pre- ventive and anti-ischemic therapies with CCTA (45-50 ). There is a high degree of concordance between CCTA- and ICA-determined obstructive CAD (33,51-55 ). CCTA- deﬁned left main stenosis (nonobstructive and $50% stenosis) is associated with a high CAD event risk (56,57). Coronary revasculariz ation confers a survival beneﬁt among patients with left main CAD (58). From randomized trials, major clinical outcomes in patients with left main CAD are similar with CABG and PCI at near-term follow-up of 1 to 2 years, although repeat revascularization rates are higher after PCI (58). 4. CCTA has been shown to be accurate for the assess- ment of native vessel CAD and bypass graft patency with high accuracy ( w96%) and concordance (82% – >93%) to ICA; it may also be useful to assess patency of proximal large stents ( $3 mm) if such information is known at the time of presentation ( 9-13). Several controlled clinical trials have evaluated the concor- dance of FFR-CT with invasive FFR (59-62 ). Diagnostic sensitivity of FFR-CT compared with invasive FFR is high (32,60). Stress Testing 5. Observational ﬁndings reveal that patients with moderate-severe ischemia on PET and SPECT MPI have an improved outcome with early coronary revascularization ( 20,34,63-65 ). Patients with moderate-severe ischemia on PET ( $10% ischemic myocardium) treated with PCI reported an improve- ment in angina when compared with those treated medically ( 20). Prespeci ﬁed substudies from thera- peutic strategy trials for SIHD also evaluated the role of rest/stress nuclear MPI to assess residual ischemia severity among patients with known CAD who were treated with medical therapy alone or when combined with revascularization ( 1,2,14-18 ). Clinical trials of CMR have included subgroups with obstructive CAD, including 76% and 49% in the MR- IMPACT and MR-IMPACT2 studies, respectively, showing generally comparable diagnostic accuracy to stress SPECT MPI (23,24). Several large, multicenter reg- istries reveal that stress CMR effectively risk strati ﬁes patients with known CAD (27-30 ). In a multicenter regis- try of 2,496 patients with a history of CAD, an abnormal stress CMR had a nearly 2-fold increased mortality hazard (27). From the SPINS Registry (Stress CMR Perfusion Im- aging in the United States),patients with known CAD with MPI ischemia and scarring by late gadolinium enhance- ment had a relative hazard of 1.5 to 2.1 for CV death or nonfatal MI (30). Prognosis worsens for patients by the extent and severity of inducible wall motion abnormal- ities on stress echocardiography (66,67). Recent random- ized trial evidence supports the role of stress echocardiography to guide clinical decision-making. From the ORBITA (Objective Randomized Blinded Investigation With Optimal Medical Therapy in Stable Angina) trial, there was a greater reduction in the stress echocardio- graphic wall motion score among patients with single- vessel CAD treated with PCI compared with placebo (p<0.0001) ( 68). In a secondary analysis, there was an interaction between the baseline stress echocardiographic w a l lm o t i o ns c o r ea n dt h ee fﬁcacy of PCI for improved angina at 6 weeks of follow-up (69). That is, PCI-treated patients with a wall motion score $1w e r em o r eo f t e n a n g i n a - f r e ec o m p a r e dw i t ht h o s ei nt h ep l a c e b oa r m . 6. Evidence supports that the improved diagnostic accu- racy of PET MPI is helpful in the patient with known CAD. In a randomized trial of 322 symptomatic patients with known CAD, the presence of low- and high-risk stress PET ﬁndings was associated with lower and higher rates of ICA when compared with SPECT MPI (p¼0.001) (37). In this trial, nearly 1 in 5 patients with low-risk SPECT MPI ﬁndings underwent ICA, a rate more than twice that of stress PET MPI. Based on such evidence, PET is preferable over SPECT when both are available. 7. Observational studies of patients with CAD and stable chest pain have demonstrate dt h a te x e r c i s et r e a d m i l l testing can be useful by evaluating the relation of JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al.

Secondary Diagnostic Testing: For the Assessment of Vascular Territory Flow or Vessel-SpeciﬁcI s c h e m i a 8. Measurement of MBFR, when reduced, reﬂects abnor- malities of ﬂow within the epicardial coronary arteries and/or microvasculature and independently predicts risk of major CAD events. This can be effectively accomplished using PET (31,70,71)o rC M R(28). Normal MBFR may be helpful in excluding high risk anatomy, although reduced levels may provide a better estimate of disease extent and severity. In the presence of nonobstructive CAD, reduced MBFR may signify coro- nary microvascular dysfunction, especially among women (70). 5.2.1.1. Patients With Prior CABG Surgery With Stable Chest Pain Recommendations for Patients With Prior CABG Surgery With Stable Chest Pain COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 C-LD 1. In patients who have had prior CABG surgery presenting with stable chest pain whose noninvasive stress test results show moderate-to-severe ischemia ( 1-7), or in those suspected to have myocardial ischemia with indeterminate/nondiagnostic stress test, IC A is recommended for guiding therapeutic decision- making (1). 2a C-LD 2. In patients who have had prior CABG surgery presenting with stable chest pain who are suspected to have myocardial ischemia, it is reasonable to perform stress imaging or CCTA to evaluate for myocardial ischemia or graft stenosis or occlusion (8-15). Synopsis In patients with prior CABG who have stable chest pain, it is important to assess medical therapies and optimize all guideline-directed therapies ( 1). ICA can be useful to guide therapeutic decision-making in those with frequent angina that has not improved with medical therapy (1-9). In those whose symptoms do improve after optimizing medical therapy, evaluation with stress testing can be useful to assess the degree of myocardial ischemia and determine which patients may bene ﬁtf r o mc o r o n a r y angiography ( 6,10). CCTA can also be used to detect graft patency but is often less robust for assessing native cor- onary vessel stenosis in those with prior CABG, because of high degree of nondiagnostic segments (8-15). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. There are stress test features in patients with prior CABG and presenting with stable chest pain that may indicate a high likelihood of severe ischemic heart dis- ease such as stress electrocardiographic ﬁndings including 2 mm of ST-segment depression at low workload or persisting into recovery, exercise-induced ST-segment elevation, or exercise-induced VT/VF, se- vere stress-induced left ventricular systolic dysfunc- tion, stress-induced perfusi on abnormalities involving $10% myocardium or stress-induced left ventricular dilation. In these patients with prior CABG and high- risk imaging features, refe rral for ICA is reasonable provided that these patients are amenable to and are candidates for coronary revascularization (1-7). Patients with prior CABG presenting with stable chest pain may have stress imaging features that are equivocal or nondiagnostic for the presence of myocardial ischemia. Equivocal or nondiagnostic stress tests may be a result of patient ’s body habitus, inadequate or suboptimal heart rate, arrhythmias such as atrial ﬁbrillation, left bundle branch block, or patient motion. In these pa- tients, performing an ICA is reasonable when the angiographic ﬁndings have a high likelihood of impacting therapeutic decisions ( 1). 2. Stable chest pain due to myocardial ischemia may occur in patients with prior CABG because of progression of atherosclerosis in the native coronary arteries or within the bypass grafts. Noninvasive stress imaging testing is reasonable in these patients to identify ischemic myocardial territories that will further guide revascularization for pa- tients who are amenable to and are candidates for revas- cularization. Furthermore, stress imaging also assists in stratifying patients to determine the degree of likelihood for severe ischemic heart disease, which will assist in thera- peutic decisions (8-10,12-14). CCTA has a great degree of accuracy with a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of detecting complete graft occlusions, 99% and 99%, respectively, when compared with the standard of ICA (20). Further- more, CCTA was ideal in assessing bypass grafts attributable to the large size of these vessels, decreased vessel calciﬁ- cation and decreased motion of these vessels when compared with native coronary vessels, with successful Gulati et al. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 2021 Chest Pain Guideline NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 e242 evaluation of bypass grafts in 93% to 100% of patients (15). In patients who have stable chest pain and are previously known to have borderline graft stenosis or are suspected to have new graft stenosis, CCTA is useful for assessing graft patency but less robust for assessing native coronary vessel stenosis in this population because of high degree of non- diagnostic segments (8-15). 5.2.2.

COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS Index Diagnostic Testing Anatomic Testing 2a B-NR 1. For symptomatic patients with known nonobstructive CAD who have stable chest pain, CCTA is reasonable for determining atherosclerotic plaque burden and progression to obstructive CAD, and guiding thera- peutic decision-making ( 1-7). 2a B-NR 2. For patients with known coronary stenosis from 40% to 90% on CCTA, FFR can be useful for diagnosis of vessel-speci ﬁc ischemia and to guide decision-making regarding the use of ICA (8-14). Stress Testing 2a C-LD 3. For patients with known extensive nonobstructive CAD with stable chest pain symptoms, stress imaging (PET/SPECT, CMR, or echocardiography) is reason able for the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia (15-24 ). Synopsis For patients with known nonobstructive CAD (luminal narrowing 1% –49%), CCTA can be useful for detection of new or worsening obstructive stenosis, atherosclerotic disease progression, and identiﬁcation of high-risk plaque features, such as low attenuation plaque or positive remodeling ( 1,2,5-7,25)( Figure 13). Similarly, stress imag- ing is reasonable to detect myocardial ischemia and can help guide further management and treatment of ischemic burden (15-24 ). Irrespective of the test performed, an overarching goal of the evaluation of symptomatic patients with known nonobstructive CAD is to identify those who would beneﬁt from intensi ﬁcation of preventive therapy, as deﬁned by the 2018 cholesterol-lowering guidelines and the 2019 prevention guidelines ( 26-29 ). For this evaluation, the patient should be engaged in a process of shared decision- making before determining the ﬁnal choice of the cardiac testing modality and in guiding the pathway for treatment decisions. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text Anatomic Testing 1. Atherosclerosis is a progre ssive disease that worsens over time ( 1), with nonobstructive CAD consistently identi ﬁed as precursor for ACS (3-6). From the PROMISE trial, nonobstructive CAD was associated with a 3-fold increase in MACE risk over w2y e a r so ff o l l o w - u p(3). Additional analyses from the SCOT-HEART and PROM- ISE trials reveal that high-ri sk atherosclerotic plaque features are associated with an elevated MACE risk among patients with nonobstructive CAD ( 4,5). CCTA commonly identi ﬁes patients with nonobstructive CAD but can further deﬁne compositional alterations within the plaque (i.e., noncalci ﬁed plaque) and positive remodeling ( 4,5,7,25,30) .T h e s ep l a q u ef e a t u r e sh a v e been associated with inducible ischemia, identi ﬁed as precursors for ACS, and independently predict MACE (5,6,31). Recently, Williams et al reported that a low attenuation plaque burden was associated with a >6- fold increase in incident MI for patients with non- obstructive CAD (4). 2. Controlled clinical trials reveal that FFR-CT improves diagnostic accuracy over and above obstructive CAD on C C T Aw h e nc o m p a r e dw i t hi n v a s i v eF F R(12,13).

From the ADVANCE (Assessing Diagnostic Value of Non-invasive FFR-CT in Coronary Care) registry, FFR-CT changed treatment recommendations in two-thirds of patients, and there were no MACE at 90 days for patients with a negative FFR-CT ( 10). From the SYNTAX 3 trial ( 14), FFR-CT was performed in 223 patients. Treatment JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 Gulati et al.

For patients with persistent stable chest pain and nonobstructive CAD and at least mild myocardial ischemia on imaging, it is reasonable to consider invasive coronary function testing to improve the diagnosis of coronary microvascular dysfunction and to enhance risk stratiﬁcation (1-4). 2a B-NR 2. For patients with persistent stable chest pain and nonobstructive CAD, stress PET MPI with MBFR is reasonable to diagnose microvascular dysfunction and enhance risk strati ﬁcation (5-11). 2a B-NR 3. For patients with persistent stable chest pain and nonobstructive CAD, stress CMR with the addition of MBFR measurement is reasonable to improve diagnosis of coronary myocardial dysfunction and for estimating risk of MACE (12-14 ). 2b C-EO 4. For patients with persistent stable chest pain and nonobstructive CAD, stress echocardiography with the addition of coronary ﬂow velocity reserve measurement may be reasonable to improve diagnosis of coronary myocardial dysfunction and for estimating risk of MACE. Synopsis Signs and symptoms of ischemia occur because of focal obstructive CAD, but INOCA is common and may result from alterations in ﬂow within the microvasculature. Thus, many symptomatic patients without obstructive CAD on previous workup may be candidates for assess- ment of coronary microvascular dysfunction and other causes of INOCA (1). Patients at highest risk for coronary microvascular dysfunction include women, those with hypertension, diabetes, and other insulin-resistant states (15). There is substantive evidence that testing focusing on documentation of coronary or microvascular ﬂow abnor- malities can aid in the diagnosis of microvascular angina, and abundant evidence supports that the addition of ﬂow alterations improves risk stratiﬁcation. Invasive cor- onary reactivity testing allows for the assessment of vasospasm, in addition to nonendothelial–dependent and endothelium-dependent microvascular reactivity ( 2,4). From the National Institutes of Health-NHLBI-sponsored WISE (Women ’s Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation), impaired coronary ﬂow reserve (i.e.,<2.32) among women with no obstructive CAD was associated with an elevated hazard for major CAD events with lengthy follow-up of 10 years (p ¼0.03) ( 2). Among women with no obstructive CAD, epicardial vasoconstriction was also signi ﬁcantly associated with higher rates of hospitalization for angina (p¼0.0002) (2). Prognostic evidence is available support- ing the novel contribution of PET MBFR techniques; several reports also note a beneﬁt using CMR and echo- cardiographic techniques. A proposed diagnostic evalua- tion pathway is outlined inFigure 14. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Evidence supports a role for invasive coronary reac- tivity testing, including prognostic evidence from the WISE study (1,2). The CorMicA (Coronary Microvascular Angina) trial enrolled symptomatic patients (74% women) without obstructive CAD and positive invasive coronary reactivity testing (n ¼76 patients to interven- tion and 75 to the blinded control group). The inter- vention consisted of anti-ischemic therapy using beta- blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme in- hibitors along with preventive care (statins) and life- style changes, including smoking cessation, and was associated with a signi ﬁcant improvement in angina and quality of life over 6 months (p¼0.001)( 4,16). This small trial did not report any differences in 6-month MACE (p¼0.8). 2. PET measurement of peak myocardial blood ﬂow and MBFR, when reduced, re ﬂects abnormalities of ﬂow Gulati et al.

PET measurement of MBFR improves risk strati ﬁcation, including for patients with non- obstructive CAD, especially women, for whom coro- nary microvascular dysfunction is suspected (18). 3. CMR has been used to evaluate MBFR. When validated against invasive coronary physiology measures, pixel- wise quantitative myocardial perfusion mapping by CMR was able to identify coronary microvascular dysfunction in a small study that included 23 patients with nonobstructive CAD (19). The addition of coronary ﬂow reserve improves prognostication ( 12-14 ). Stress CMR studies of MBFR have shown reasonable agree- ment with PET (n¼21) (20). 4. Stress echocardiography assessing coronary ﬂow ve- locity reserve in the left anterior descending artery with Doppler can currently be combined with wall motion analysis during vasodilator stress echocardi- ography. Limited data have shown that abnormal cor- onary ﬂow velocity reserve ( #2) adds incremental value to the prognostic strati ﬁcation achieved with clinical and angiographic data for events such as death and nonfatal MI in patients with angiographically FIGURE 14 Clinical Decision Pathway for INOCA Test choice should be guided by local availability and expertise. *Ford T, et al.

Cost-Value Considerations in Diagnostic Testing A general concept regarding cost is that layered testing (i.e., when a test is followed by more tests) leads to higher costs. To minimize the potential needs for downstream testing, clinicians should select the test that is most likely to answer a particular question. 5.3.1. CCTA and CAC Scanning Cost-Value Considerations In the outpatient setting, long-term costs were generally similar between CCTA and stress testing strategies ( 1). Higher invasive angiography rates after CCTA are matched by a greater use of downstream stress testing after initial stress testing, resulting in minimal differences in cost at 2 to 3 years of follow-up ( 1,2). From the CONSERVE (Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiog- raphy for Selective Cardiac Catheterization) trial, 823 pa- tients were randomized to a selective versus direct referral strategy to ICA. Enrollment was limited to pa- tients with nonemergent indications for ICA ( 3). The se- lective referral arm included CCTA-guided use of ICA. Cumulative diagnostic costs were $1,183 for the selective arm and $2,755 for the direct referral arm of the C O N S E R V Et r i a l( 5 7 %l o w e rc o s t s ) .I nt h eC C T A - g u i d e d arm, follow-up stress testing was applied and contrib- uted to reduced referrals to ICA. A recent tiered testing strategy was evaluated in both the CRESCENT I and II trials (2,4). From the CRESCENT I trial, CAC was used as the index test, with follow-up CCTA used only in patients with detectable CAC or for those with a high pretest risk ( 2). In this trial, nearly 40% of patients did not undergo CCTA, which reduced diagnostic evaluation cost s; no events were reported in this subgroup. By comparison, nearly half of those ran- domized to the exercise ECG had additional con ﬁrma- tory diagnostic testing. Overall, 1-year costs were signi ﬁcantly lower in the CAC tiered testing protocol (16% cost savings; p <0.0001) ( 2). Moreover, 1-year MACE-free survival was higher in the CAC-guided t e s t i n ga r m( 9 7 % )c o m p a r e dw i t he x e r c i s eE C G( 9 0 % ; HR: 0.32; p¼0.011). 5.3.2. Exercise Electrocardiographic Cost-Value Considerations The economic evidence for the exercise ECG supports that tiered testing may offset its reduced diagnostic accuracy (1,2). In a decision model, tiered testing of exercise ECG followed by selective stress echocardiography resulted in improved diagnostic accuracy and favorable cost- effective ratios when compared with other testing stra- tegies (2). In a Medicare cohort, observed 180-day costs were lowest for the exercise ECG when compared with stress echocardiography, MPI, or CCTA ( 3). Randomized trial data on cost are available and from the PROMISE trial initial test costs were $174 for exercise ECG,>50% lower than that of other imaging procedures (4). At 3-years of follow-up, the mean cost difference was $1,731 higher for CCTA (n¼4818) when compared with the exercise ECG (n¼858); however, the 95% CIs for cost differences was wide ($2 to $3,519), and there was no overall difference by randomization (4). Overall, results from the PROMISE trial showed that stress testing was associated with similar c o s t sa n dC A Do u t c o m e so v e rw3y e a r so ff o l l o w - u p(4,5). In a randomized trial of 824 symptomatic women, cu- mulative procedural costs were nearly 50% lower for ex- ercise ECG versus MPI SPECT (p <0.0001), with no difference in 2-year event-free survival (p¼ 0.59) (6). 5.3.3. Stress Echocardiographic Cost-Value Considerations Several cost-effectiveness models have reported an increased incremental cost-e ffectiveness ratio for stress echocardiography, compare d with exercise ECG and other diagnostic procedures ( 1-4). In these models, cost- effectiveness was in ﬂuenced by an improved diagnostic accuracy for stress echocardiography, which led to longer life expectancy ( 1). In a recent systematic review, the evidence supports that stress echocardiography or stress MPI are cost-effective for those patients at intermediate pretest risk (5). The improved CAD detection for exercise echocardiography resulted in fewer of ﬁce and ED visits and hospital days, yielding a 20% cost savings when c o m p a r e dw i t ht h ee x e r c i s eE C G(6). There were 2,204 patients that underwent stress echocardiography in the PROMISE trial, and 3-year mean costs were similar to that of CCTA (CCTA – stress echocardiography mean cost dif- ference: –$363; 95% CI: –$1,562 to $818) (7). 5.3.4. Stress Nuclear MPI Cost-Value Considerations Among intermediate-risk patients, evidence synthesis supports that stress MPI is a cost-effective test option (1). From the SPARC (Study of Myocardial Perfusion and Coronary Anatomy Imaging Roles in Coronary Artery Disease) registry, observed 2-year mortality rate was h i g h e s tf o rP E TM P I( 5 . 5 % )c o m p a r e dw i t hC C T A( 0 . 7 % )o r SPECT MPI (1.6%), with 2-year cost highest for patients undergoing PET ( 2). In the PROMISE trial, nearly two- thirds of patients underwent stress MPI, and the mean cost was similar when compared with CCTA ( 3). Mean costs were also similar in a randomized trial of 457 pa- tients comparing stress MPI with exercise ECG (p >0.05) (4). Among higher-likelihood patients in the UK enrolled in the CECaT (Cost Effectiveness of Noninvasive Cardiac Testing) trial, MPI SPECT was the most cost-effective approach (5). Gulati et al. JACC VOL. 78, NO. 22, 2021 2021 Chest Pain Guideline NOVEMBER 30, 2021:e187 – e285 e246 5.3.5. Stress CMR Cost-Value Considerations A synthesis of this cost evidence reveals a pattern whereby CMR perfusion and scar imaging is associated with a favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of <$50,000 per quality-adjusted life years saved ( 1,2). From a single report, a CMR strategy informed by the CE- MARC trial was more cost-effective than stress MPI, largely because of the higher diagnostic accuracy for CMR (2). However, the most cost-effective strategy was that of initial exercise ECG followed by selective stress CMR and invasive angiography; for this tiered testing approach, additional testing was deemed appropriate in the setting of abnormal or inconclusive ﬁndings. In a decision model for intermediate pretest risk patients, a strategy of CMR followed by selective ICA had projected reduced costs by w25% when compared with direct referral to ICA ( 2,3). From the Stress CMR Perfusion Imaging in the United States registry ( 4), patients with negative ﬁndings for ischemia and scar had low downstream costs (5). 6. EVIDENCE GAPS AND FUTURE RESEARCH Chest pain is one of the most common symptoms for which a person seeks medical care, and it should there- fore be the target of substantial research investigation. 1. For patients with ACS, considerable success has been achieved in reducing door-to-balloon times for STEMI, but little progress has been made in reducing the important delays from symptom onset to presentation. Further research is needed to develop approaches to shorten this interval including studies of other methods of evaluating patients with chest pain using technologies that permit acquisition and transmission of ECGs from home and remote evaluations (e.g., tel- ehealth) for those with acute symptoms (1,2). 2. An important, increasing patient population includes women and men with angina and ACS associated with angiographically normal or nonobstructive coronary arteries (3,4). Prognosis is not benign, pathophysiology has not been clariﬁed, and optimal therapy is unclear in these heterogeneous groups, which are now considered in terms of INOCA ( 5)a n dM I N O C A(6). Adequately identifying patients with INOCA, and completing an evaluation to make such a diagnosis, is necessary but often not done, regardless of whether chest pain is assessed in the ED, inpatient, or outpa- tient setting. Further investigation to clarify disease mechanisms in these challenging syndromes is needed to provide the basis for therapeutic advances. 3. One of the initial challenges in the evaluation of pa- tients with chest pain, either in the emergency or ofﬁce setting, is symptom classi ﬁcation. Methods to elicit symptoms and clusters of symptoms that provide improved pretest probabilities of symptomatic CAD may be aided with machine-le arning algorithms. It is already clear that some common dogma about chest pain descriptions, such as differences between men a n dw o m e n ,m a yn o tb ea sp r e v a l e n ta sh a sb e e nr e - ported (7) and may impede care of both sexes if they do not ﬁt preconceived notions of the clinical signiﬁcance of their symptoms. However, reducing the differences in both sex and racial differences in treatment and outcomes are important future goals of research and clinical care. 4. Clinical risk stratiﬁcation and decision tools will likely continue to grow in popularity because they are incorporated into electronic health records, but it would be useful to test them in large randomized trials to rigorously determine their bene ﬁti nt e r m so f improved outcomes or lower costs before widespread implementation ( 1). hs-cTn assays are now the global standard of care for identifying myocardial injury, although questions remain about whether minimal el- evations, which carry prognostic value, are actionable in a manner that improves outcomes. Trials evaluating various medical and procedural strategies would be useful including diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms f o rM I N O C A .T h en u m b e ro fp o t e n t i a lq u e s t i o n st h a t could be addressed will demand innovative trial de- signs to use resources efﬁciently and meaningfully. 5. Increasingly, randomized trials will be performed to determine which diagnostic tests can be eliminated from initial and follow-up care, both to streamline management algorithms and to decrease health care costs. In part, this approach will encompass evaluation of where patients with chest pain should be initially evaluated and monitored. Comparison of the various imaging modalities in randomized trials should help reﬁne test selection and use (8). Thus, the diagnosis and management of chest pain will remain a fertile area of investigation, with randomized evaluations complementing insights provided by regis- tries of patients presenting with chest pain (9-12). In the future, registries will more frequently serve as platforms within which to conduct randomized trials. Accreditation activities coupled with registry participation will also need to be evaluated to determine if they not only improve processes of care but also affect clinical end- points (12). Assessment of long-term outcomes, patient- centered metrics, and cost will be integrated into these studies to enhance the evidence base for care of patients presenting with chest pain with greater precision.

Joseph Woo, MD, FACC, FAHA Boback Ziaeian, MD, P HD, FAHA ABSTRACT AIM The “2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation” provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the treatment of patients with atrialﬁbrillation. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 12, 2022, to November 3, 2022, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through November 2022, during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables, where appropriate. STRUCTURE Atrial ﬁbrillation is the most sustained common arrhythmia, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing in the United States and globally. Recommendations from the“2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation” and the“2019 AHA/ACC/HRS Focused Update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation” have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing atrial ﬁbrillation and thromboembolic risk assessment, anticoagulation, left atrial appendage occlusion, atrialﬁbrillation catheter or sur- gical ablation, and risk factor modiﬁcation and atrialﬁbrillation prevention have been developed.

Stages of atrial ﬁbrillation (AF): The previous classi- ﬁcation of AF, which was based only on arrhythmia duration, although useful, tended to emphasize ther- apeutic interventions. The new proposed classi ﬁca- t i o n ,u s i n gs t a g e s ,r e c o g n i z e sA Fa sad i s e a s e continuum that requires a variety of strategies at the different stages, from prevention, lifestyle and risk factor modiﬁcation, screening, and therapy. 2. AF risk factor modi ﬁcation and prevention: This guideline recognizes lifestyle and risk factor modi ﬁ- cation as a pillar of AF management to prevent onset, progression, and adverse outcomes. The guideline emphasizes risk factor management throughout the disease continuum and offers more prescriptive rec- ommendations, accordingly, including management of obesity, weight loss, physical activity, smoking Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 112 cessation, alcohol moderation, hypertension, and other comorbidities. 3. Flexibility in using clinical risk scores and expanding beyond CHA 2DS2-VASc for prediction of stroke and systemic embolism: Recommendations for anti- coagulation are now made based on yearly thrombo- embolic event risk using a validated clinical risk score, such as CHA 2DS2-VASc. However, patients at an in- termediate annual risk sc ore who remain uncertain about the beneﬁt of anticoagulation can beneﬁtf r o m consideration of other risk variables to help inform the decision, or the use of other clinical risk scores to improve prediction, facilitate shared decision making, and incorporate into the electronic medical record. 4. Consideration of stroke risk modiﬁers: Patients with AF at intermediate to low ( <2%) annual risk of ischemic stroke can bene ﬁt from consideration of factors that might modify their risk of stroke, such as the characteristics of their AF (eg, burden), non- modiﬁable risk factors (sex), and other dynamic or modiﬁable factors (blood pressure control) that may inform shared decision-making discussions. 5. Early rhythm control: With the emergence of new and consistent evidence, this guideline emphasizes the importance of early and continued management of patients with AF that should focus on maintaining sinus rhythm and minimizing AF burden. 6. Catheter ablation of AF receives a Class 1 indication as ﬁrst-line therapy in selected patients: Recent randomized studies have demonstrated the superior- ity of catheter ablation over drug therapy for rhythm control in appropriately selected patients. In view of the most recent evidence, we upgraded the Class of Recommendation. 7. Catheter ablation of AF in appropriate patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction receives a Class 1 indication: Recent randomized studies have demonstrated the superiority of catheter ablation over drug therapy for rhythm control in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection failure. In view of the data, we upgraded the Class of Recommendation for this population of patients. 8. Recommendations have been updated for device- detected AF: In view of recent studies, more pre- scriptive recommendations are provided for patients with device-detected AF that consider the interaction between episode duration and the patient’su n d e r l y - ing risk for thromboembolism. This includes consid- erations for patients with AF detected via implantable devices and wearables. 9. Left atrial appendage occlusion devices receive higher level Class of Recommendation: In view of additional data on safety and ef ﬁcacy of left atrial appendage occlusion devices, the Class of Recom- mendation has been upgraded to 2a compared with the 2019 AF Focused Update for use of these devices in patients with long-term contraindications to anticoagulation. 10. Recommendations are made for patients with AF identi ﬁed during medical illness or surgery (pre- cipitants): Emphasis is made on the risk of recurrent A Fa f t e rA Fi sd i s c o v e r e dd u r i n gn o n c a r d i a ci l l n e s so r other precipitants, such as surgery. PREAMBLE Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated scien- tiﬁc evidence into clinical prac tice guidelines with rec- ommendations to improve cardiovascular health. These guidelines, which are based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a foundation for the delivery of quality cardiovascular care. The ACC and AHA sponsor the development and publication of clinical practice guidelines without commercial support, and members volunteer their time to the writing and review efforts. Guidelines are the ofﬁcial policy of the ACC and AHA. For some guidelines, the ACC and AHA collaborate with other organizations. Intended Use Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing car- diovascular disease. The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but these guidelines are relevant to patients throughout the world. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients’ in- terests. Guidelines are intended to de ﬁne practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, cir- cumstances and should not replace clinical judgment. Clinical Implementation Management, in accordance with guideline recommen- dations, is effective only when followed by both practi- tioners and patients. Adherence to recommendations can be enhanced by shared decision-making between clini- cians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, prefer- ences, and associated conditions and comorbidities. Methodology and Modernization The ACC/AHA Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines (Joint Committee) continuously reviews, up- dates, and modiﬁes guideline methodology on the basis of published standards from or ganizations, including the JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 113 Institute of Medicine, 1,2 and on the basis of internal reevaluation. Similarly, presentation and delivery of guidelines are reevaluated and modi ﬁed in response to evolving technologies and other factors to optimally facilitate dissemination of information to health care professionals at the point of care. Numerous modi ﬁcations to the guidelines have been implemented to make them shorter and enhance “user friendliness. ” Guidelines are written and presented in a modular, “knowledge chunk ” format, in which each chunk includes a table of recommendations, a brief syn- opsis, recommendation-speci ﬁc supportive text and, when appropriate, ﬂow diagrams or additional tables. Hyperlinked references are provided for each modular knowledge chunk to facilitate quick access and review. In recognition of the importance of cost–value consid- erations, in certain guidelines, when appropriate and feasible, an analysis of value for a drug, device, or inter- vention may be performed in accordance with the ACC/ AHA methodology. 3 To ensure that guideline recommendations remain current, new data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the writing committee and staff. Going forward, targeted sections/knowledge chunks will be revised dynamically after publication and timely peer review of potentially practice-changing science. The previous designations of “full revision ” and “focused update ” will be phased out. For additional information and policies on guideline development, readers may consult the ACC/AHA guide- line methodology manual 4 and other methodology arti- cles. 5-7 Selection of Writing Committee Members The Joint Committee strives to ensure that the guideline writing committee contains requisite content expertise and is representati ve of the broader cardiovas- cular community by selection of experts across a spec- trum of backgrounds, representing different geographic regions, sexes, races, ethnic ities, intellectual perspec- tives/biases, and clinical prac tice settings. Organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise are invited to participate as partners or collaborators. Relationships With Industry and Other Entities The ACC and AHA have rigorous policies and methods to ensure that documents are developed without bias or improper inﬂuence. The complete policy on relationships with industry and other entities (RWI) can be found on- line. Appendix 1 of the guideline lists writing committee members ’ comprehensive and relevant RWI; for the pur- poses of full transparency, comprehensive and relevant disclosure information for the Joint Committee is also available online . Evidence Review and Evidence Review Committees In developing recommendations, the writing committee uses evidence-based methodologies that are based on all available data. 4,5 Literature searches focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include registries, non- randomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. Only key references are cited. An independent evidence review committee is commissioned when there are $1 questions deemed of utmost clinical importance and merit formal systematic review to determine which patients are most likely to beneﬁt from a drug, device, or treatment strategy, and to what degree. Criteria for commissioning an evidence re- view committee and formal systematic review include absence of a current authoritative systematic review, feasibility of deﬁning the beneﬁt and risk in a time frame consistent with the writing of a guideline, relevance to a substantial number of patients, and likelihood that the ﬁndings can be translated into actionable recommenda- tions. Evidence review committee members may include methodologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and bio- statisticians. Recommendati ons developed by the writing committee on the basis of the systematic review are marked “ SR”. Guideline-Directed Management and Therapy The term guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT) encompasses clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, and both pharmacolog ical and procedural treat- ments. For these and all recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader should conﬁrm dosage with product insert material and evaluat e for contraindications and interactions. Recommendations are limited to drugs, de- vices, and treatments approved for clinical use in the United States.

BACKGROUND AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY 2.1. Epidemiology Atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) is the most sustained common arrhythmia, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing in the United States and globally ( Figures 1 to 3). 1,2 The increasing burden is multifactorial; causes include the aging of the population, rising tide of obesity, increasing detection, and increasing survival with AF and other forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The esti- mated global prevalence was 50 million in 2020. 2,3 Although the prevalence of undiagnosed AF in the com- munity is unknown, using back-calculation methodology, investigators have estimated that, in 2015, about 11% (591,000 cases) of the>5.6 million AF cases in the United States were undiagnosed. 4 AF is associated with higher health care utilization and costs. 2 Using US data from Optum (an administrative claims database for commercially insured [United Healthcare] patients in the United States), compared with patients without AF, patients with incident AF had an increased risk of inpatient visits and more cardiovascular- related emergency department visits (relative risk [RR], 2.41 [95% CI, 2.35–2.47]). 5 AF is costly. Examining Optum data, individuals with AF have annual health care costs of $63,031, which is $27,896 more than individuals without AF. 5 Investigators examining public and private health insurer data estimated that in U.S. dollars in 2016, AF accounted for $28.4 billion (95% CI, $24.6 billion –$33.8 billion) in health care spending. 6 2.1.1. Prevalence, Incidence, Morbidity, and Mortality AF prevalence in the United States was estimated to be 5.2 million in 2010, with an expectation to rise to 12.1 million in 2030. 1 Corresponding estimates for U.S. incidence was 1.2 million cases in 2010, with an expectation to rise to 2.6 FIGURE 1 Temporal Trends in Counts and Age-Standardiz ed Rates of AF-Prevalent Cases by Social Demographic Index Quintile for Both Sexes Combined, 1990 –2017 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2017 High SDI High-middle SDIMiddle SDI Low-middle SDILow SDI 0 5 000 000 10 000 000 15 000 000 20 000 000 25 000 000 30 000 000 35 000 000 40 000 000Counts of prevalent cases Year Trends in counts of AF-prevalent cases by SDI quintile, 1990–2017.

Overall lifetime risk is about 30% to 40% in White in- dividuals, 2-4 about 20% in African American individuals,2 and about 15% in Chinese5 individuals. AF is associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of death 6,7; studies suggest that the mortality risk may be higher in women than in men.6 In meta-analyses, AF is also associated with increased risk of multiple adverse outcomes, including a 2.4-fold risk of stroke, 7 1.5-fold risk of cognitive impairment or dementia, 8 1.5-fold risk of myocardial infarction (MI), 9 2-fold risk of sudden cardiac death, 10 5-fold risk of heart failure (HF),7 1.6-fold risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD), 7 and 1.3-fold risk of pe- ripheral artery disease (PAD). 7 In Medicare beneﬁciaries, t h em o s tf r e q u e n to u t c o m ei nt h e5y e a r sa f t e rA Fd i a g - nosis was death (19.5% at 1 year; 48.8% at 5 years) 11;t h e next most common diagnosis was HF (13.7%), followed by new-onset stroke (7.1%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (5.7%), and MI (3.9%). 11 FIGURE 2 Prevalence of AF Among Medicare Beneﬁciaries, 1993 –2007 (A) In the overall cohort,(B) by age group,(C) by sex, and(D) by race.

Risk factors include demographic, anthropometric, and cardiovascular risk factors, CVD, noncardiac conditions, biomarkers (eg, electrocardiographic, imaging, circu- lating), and genetic markers. 1 Models predicting risk of AF onset are presented in Section 4.1 (“Risk Strati ﬁcation and Population Screening ”). Most studies of AF risk fac- tors and outcomes have been reported from high-income countries and in individuals of European ancestry.

Atrial Arrhythmia Classiﬁcation and Deﬁnitions 2.2.1. AF Classiﬁcation The previous classi ﬁcation of AF, which was based only on arrhythmia duration, although useful, tended to emphasize AF once it was diagnosed and focused mainly on therapeutic interventions. The new proposed classi ﬁ- cation using stages aims to correct the deﬁciencies of the previous classi ﬁcation by recognizing AF as a progressive disease that requires different strategies at the different stages, from prevention to screening, to rate and rhythm control therapies. The different stages better deﬁne AF as a progressive disease and highlight the need to address it at the earliest stages, especially emphasizing the impor- tance of prevention, risk factor management, and timing for screening in those patients at the highest risk. The stages are not mutually exclusive (eg, risk factors should be managed through multiple stages) (Figure 4). AF is the most common arrhythmia in the world and accounts for signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality. Over the past decade, evidence has consistently shown that the best treatment of atrial ﬁbrillation requires multiple TABLE 3 Continued Condition Study Type Effect on Risk of AF Summary Risk of Incident AF Effect of LRFM Imaging markers LA size or function n Single studies n LA anterior-posterior dimension: [ risk (HR per 5 mm[,1 . 3 9 )84 n End diastolic LA volume (min):[ risk (HR, 1.12)85 n LA emptying fraction: [ risk (HR, 1.03)85 [ LA size, emptying fraction: [ risk Surgical LA reduction in conjunction with cardiac surgery or surgical AF ablation in patients with persistent AF may[ rates of sinus rhythm86-89 n MR n Genetic susceptibility to AF (independent measure) is associated with [indexed LA size and Y LA ejection fraction (dependent measures) 90 LV wall thickness n Single study n LV posterior wall thickness: [ risk (HR per 4-mm [,1 . 2 8 )84 [ Risk N/A n SR/MA n LVH: [ risk (RR, 1.46)79 Social determinants of health Education n Single studies n Higher education: [ lifetime risk of AF (U.S.-based ARIC study) 91 n Higher education in young individuals: Y risk of AF diagnosis (Danish study)92 Variable [Y risk N/A n MR n AF risk related but largely mediated via BMI (57.5%), type 2 diabetes (9.8%), SBP (18.7%), and smoking (7.1%)93 Income n Single studies n Higher income: [ lifetime risk of AF (U.S.-based ARIC study) 91 n Higher income in young individuals: Y risk of AF diagnosis (Danish study)92 Variable [Y risk N/A SES n Single studies n Cumulative socioeconomic disadvantage: [ risk (HR, 1.57)94 n Individual ’s poorest areas: 12% [ dr i s k95 Low SES:[4 risk N/A n SR/MA n Heterogeneous results 96 Genetics Family history/ heritability n Single studies n Family history of AF: [ risk97-99 [ Risk N/A n MR n Proportion heritability explained by loci in European ancestry analysis, 42% 100 GWAS n MA n Number of AF risk loci[sw i t h[ number of subjects studied.

In addi tion, as emphasized in this guideline, AF should be thought of in a more holistic sense over an individual patient’s lifetime. The foundation of optimal AF management is the treatment of risk factors an d implementing lifestyle changes to decrease the likelihood of developing AF (Figure 5). Once AF develops, patient care should focus on assessing the risk of stroke and implementing any necessary treatment, continued optimization of all modiﬁable risk factors, and managing potential symp- toms of AF, with an initial focus on evaluating and minimizing AF burden. However, as outlined in this guideline, access to all aspects of health care to all pa- tients is necessary for any true improvement to be realized. When AF develops, holistic and optimal care of the patient at risk for AF, or who has developed AF, can be simply modeled using a building. The foundation of care is treatment of comorbidities and risk factors and imple- menting behavioral change in all individuals to decrease the likelihood of developing AF and reducing its burden (Screening for all risk factors fromHEAD 2 TOES). Once AF develops, there are 3 important care processes that must be speci ﬁcally addressed with all patients and aligned with their goals of therapy: Stroke risk assessment and treatment, if appropriate, Optimizing all modi ﬁable risk factors, and Symptom management using rate- and rhythm-control strategies th at consider AF burden in the context of an individual patient’s needs (SOS) .T h eo v e r - arching principle for AF management is Access to All Aspects of care toAll (4A s). 2.2.2. Associated Arrhythmias Other atrial arrhythmias are often encountered in patients with AF. Atrial Tachycardia (AT): It is a regular atrial rhythm at ac o n s t a n tr a t eo f>100 beats per minute (bpm) with discrete P waves and atrial activation sequences origi- nating outside of the sinus node. 1 The mechanism can be automaticity, triggered activity, or a microreentry circuit. Focal ATs arise from a single discrete site within the left or right atrium, in contrast to macroreentrant atrial ar- rhythmias and AF, which involve multiple sites or larger circuits. In multifocal AT, the atrial activation sequence and P-wave morphology vary. Atrial Flutter (AFL) and Macroreentrant AT: They occur in many of the same situations as AF. Typical AFL, also known as “typical AFL ” or “cavotricuspid isthmus FIGURE 4 AF Stages: Evolution of Atrial Arrhythmia Progression *Heart failure, valve disease, coronary artery disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, neuromuscular disorders, thyroid disease.Original ﬁgure created by the 2023 Atrial Fibrillation Guideline Writing Committee.AF indicates atrialﬁbrillation. Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 124 TABLE 4 Deﬁnitions Term Deﬁnition AF A supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with uncoordinated atrial activation and ineffective atrial contraction Electrocardiographic characteristics include (1) irregular R-R intervals (when atrioventricular conduction is present), (2) absence of distinct P waves, and (3) irregular atrial activity also known asﬁbrillatory waves. AF can be documented by, for example, 12-lead ECG, rhythm strips, wearables, intracardiac electrograms, but will always require visual conﬁrmation that the diagnosis is accurate. Clinical AF With the increasing availability of wearable devices and other continuous monitoring technologies, the distinction between clinical a nd subclinical AF has become increasingly blurred, thus the writing committee felt the term clinical AF has become less useful. Yet, the term was kept because most of the evidence from randomized trials that have led to guideline recommendations for the treatment of AF refer to “clinical AF.” These trials required electrocardiographic documentation of the arrhythmia for inclusion and most patients presented for clinical evaluation and/or therapy of the arrhythmia. Subclinical AF Subclinical AF refers to this arrhythmia identi ﬁed in individuals who do not have symptoms attributable to AF and in whom there are no previous ECGs documenting AF This includes AF identiﬁed by implanted devices (pacemakers, deﬁbrillators, or implantable loop recorders) or wearable monitors Atrial high-rate episodes These are deﬁned as atrial events exceeding the programmed detection rate limit set by the device. These are recorded by implanted devices but require visual inspection to conﬁrm AF and exclude other atrial arrhythmias, artifact or oversensing. AF burden AF burden encompasses both frequency and duration and refers to the amount of AF that an individual has. AF burden has been de ﬁned differently across studies. For the purpose of this guideline, AF burden will be deﬁned as the durations of an an episode or as a percentage of AF duration during the monitoring period depending on how it was deﬁned in the individual studies. First detected AF The ﬁrst documentation of AF, regardless of previous symptoms Paroxysmal AF AF that is intermittent and terminates within #7 d of onset Persistent AF AF that is continuous and sustains for >7 d and requires intervention. Of note, patients with persistent AF who, with therapy, become paroxysmal should still be deﬁned as persistent as this reﬂects their original pattern and is more useful to predict outcomes and deﬁne substrate. Long-standing persistent AF AF that is continuous for>12 mo in duration Permanent AF A term that is used when the patient and clinician make a joint decision to stop further attempts to restore and/or maintain sinus rhythm Acceptance of AF represents a therapeutic decision and does not represent an inherent pathophysiological attribute of AF Continued on the next page FIGURE 5 Pillars for AF Management AF indicates atrialﬁbrillation. JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 125 TABLE 4 Continued Term Deﬁnition Terms considered obsolete Chronic AF This historical term has had variable de ﬁnitions and should be abandoned. It has been replaced by the“paroxysmal,”“ persistent,”“ long- standing persistent,” and “permanent” terminology. Valvular and nonvalvular AF The distinction between“valvular” and “nonvalvular “AF remains a matter of debate. Their deﬁnitions may be confusing. Recent trials comparing vitamin K antagonists with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in AF were performed among patients with so-called “nonvalvular” AF. These trials have all allowed native valvular heart disease other than mitral stenosis (mostly moderate and severe) and prosthetic heart valves to be included. We should no longer consider the classiﬁcation of AF as‘‘valvular’’or “nonvalvular” for the purpose of deﬁning the etiology of AF, since the term was speciﬁc for eligibility of stroke risk reduction therapies. Valvular and nonvalvular terminology should be abandoned. Lone AF This term has been used in the past to identify AF in younger patients without structural heart disease who are at a lower risk for thromboembolism. This term does not enhance patient care, is not currently used, and should be abandoned. AF indicates atrialﬁbrillation.

This is the arrhythmia associated with the classic electrocardiogram (ECG) ﬁnding of sawtooth ﬂutter waves in the inferior leads when the circuit goes in the counterclockwise direction. The same circuit in the clockwise direction is called “reverse typical AFL. ” If the ﬂutter involves a different circuit than tricuspid valve/isthmus, then it is called “atypical ” AFL, which is also known as“noncavotricuspid isthmus –dependent macroreentrant AT. ” 2 AFL was pre- viously classi ﬁed as either type I or type II. That termi- nology is no longer used. 2.3. Mechanisms and Pathophysiology AF is a chaotic, rapid (300-500 bpm), and irregular atrial rhythm. Although normal rhythms are conducted through the atria in smooth waves initiated by the sinoatrial node, AF is the result of either electrophysiological abnormal- ities that underlie impulse generation and/or structural abnormalities of cellular conne ctions that typically facil- itate rapid and uniform impulse conduction. AF often stems from waves of electrical activity originating from ectopic action potentials most commonly generated in the pulmonary veins (PVs) of the left atrium (LA), 1 or in response to reentrant activity promoted by heteroge- neous conduction due to interstitial ﬁbrosis. 2 Atrial ectopy can generate runs of tachycardia, while persistent AF requires a substrate that is either sufﬁciently large or conduction that is suf ﬁciently heterogeneous to enable reentrant activity to persist. The electrical abnormalities evident on the ECG during AF likely represent a shared phenotype of a condition with many distinct etiologies (genetic, environmental, and metabolic) ( Figure 7). FIGURE 7 Mechanisms and Pathways Leading to AF The pathways that contribute to the development of AF create a substrate for reentry and provide triggers that can initiate arrhythmic activity. AF indicates atrial ﬁbrillation; PAC, premature atrial contraction; NLRP3, NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3; and RAAS, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 127 2.3.1. Electrophysiological Mechanisms and Electrical Remodeling The observation by Haissaguerre et al1 that ectopic ﬁring f r o mP V st r i g g e r sA Fr e v o l u t i o n i z e dt r e a t m e n t sf o rA F .P V features that increase vulnerability for initiating ectopy include a higher resting mem brane potential, stretch- activated channels, 2 and pattern of cross myo ﬁber orientation. Electrical remodeling, which can contribute to and result from AF, includes perturbations that culminate in abnormal Ca 2þ handling and shortened, proarrhythmic triangulated action potentials (eg, from decreased L-type Ca2þ current 3 and increase in IK1).4 Heterogeneity in I K1 between left and right atria further promotes arrhyth- mogenicity. 5 Downregulation of connexin results in decreased gap junctions, leading to slow heterogeneous atrial conduction velocity and repolarization, 6 promoting regional functional conduction block that can support reentry. Connexin remodeling can be due to genetic 7 or acquired factors, such as inﬂammatory state, 8,9 older age, or sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). 10 Calcium mishandling from remodeling increases cal- cium load in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and dysfunction of ryanodine receptors, which regulate intracellular cal- cium release. Remodeling in AF of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase underlies sequestration of intracellular calcium between beats, and/or altered regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase by phospho- lamban and sarcolipin. 11 Increased intracellular sodium from calcium-calmodulin II-induced increased late so- dium current or cardiac glycosides can also increase sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium through the sodium- calcium exchanger. 12,13 Several upstream mechanisms (eg, oxidative stress, in ﬂammatory signaling) promote calcium-calmodulin II -activation. CaMKII-mediated and hyperphosphorylation of ryanodine receptor 2 promotes spontaneous diastolic Ca 2þ leak by increasing ryanodine receptor 2 channel open probability, leading to higher intracellular Ca 2þ levels and the milieu for delayed afterdepolarizations, the mo st likely trigger for AF initi- ation. 14 Electrogenic action of sodium-calcium exchanger drives afterdepolarizations, and expression of sodium- calcium exchanger is increased in HF and AF. Action po- tential alternans related to Ca 2þ mishandling can be noted to precede AF onset and increases with age. 2.3.1.1. Triggers of AF The atria of patients with AF tend to have both shorter effective refractory periods and slower conduction, which enhances dispersion of repolarization and favor reentry. This substrate is sensitive to AF initiation, frequently af- ter premature atrial contractions (PACs). 1 PAC burden is associated with development of AF. 2 Larger LA volume, increased NT-proBNP levels , and impaired LA emptying are associated with increased PAC burden.3 In a study of 100 patients undergoing PV isolation, PACs induced 41 episodes of AF in 22 patients, with most episodes origi- nating in the PVs. 4 Earlier studies also reported an LA gradient of background potassium currents, resulting in shorter LA than right atrial effective refractory period in patients with AF. 5 Mapping studies of AF electrograms in canine models documented a left-right gradient of high frequency sources (drivers), with the highest frequency regions located near the PVs in the LA. 6 2.3.2. Atrial Structural Abnormalities, Remodeling, and Atrial Myopathy Atrial cardiomyopathy has been identi ﬁed as “any com- plex of structural, architect ural, contractile or electro- physiological changes affecting the atria with the potential to produce clinically relevant manifestations. ” 1 Atrial cardiomyopathy is common, associated with aging and other comorbidities with metabolic or hemodynamic stress, and often leads to or results from AF. Structural and electrical remodeling promote AF and include interstitial changes, increased myo ﬁbroblast activity, and collagen deposition, ﬁbrofatty deposits, altered ion channel expression, calcium signaling and contractility, and in- ﬂammatory in ﬁltrates. 1 Myeloperoxidase, an oxidase in neutrophils and macrophages, is associated withﬁbroblast activation, interstitial ﬁbrosis, and inducibility of AF in a mouse model.2 Prothrombotic changes are often evident in the LA, including increased endocardial expression of von Willebrand factor, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 changes, which may increase risk of thrombusformation and stroke. 1 Experimental hemodynamic overload, such as revers- ible aortopulmonary artery shunting promotes atrial dilation, atrial myocyte hypertrophy, interstitial ﬁbrosis, alterations in extracellula r matrix composition and vascular dysfunction, and increased vulnerability to atrial ectopy and AF inducibility.3 Electrical remodeling similar to that seen during AF is observed, with characteristic loss of calcium currents. Shunt closure reverses electrophysi- ological changes. 3 Clinically, the hemodynamic structural changes are difﬁcult or impossible to reverse. 2.3.2.1. Upstream Pathways Upstream pathways include in ﬂammatory, oxidative stress, ﬁbrosis, calcium handling, genetic, metabolic, obesity, and other mechanisms implicated in increasing susceptibility to or prog ression of AF. The renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), oxidative stress, inﬂammatory signaling, and calcium overload are dis- cussed here and in Section 2.3.1 (“Electrophysiological Mechanisms and Electrical Remodeling ”).U p s t r e a m Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 128 therapies are discussed in Section 8.3.4 (“Upstream Therapy ”). The RAAS regulates blood pressure (BP) and is acti- vated in hypertension and obesity. RAAS activation pro- motes vascular smooth muscle constriction (increasing BP), activates ﬁbroblasts (increasing atrial interstitial collagen), and increases reactive oxygen species in the sympathetic nervous system. BP and weight control, including treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor blockers, attenuate pathologic changes. Oxidative stress is associated with: (1) activation of calcium-dependent calmodulin kinase II 1,2 and jun kinase 2,3 which promotes ryanodine receptor phosphor- ylation and leads to spontaneous calcium release 4;( 2 ) increased late sodium current, I Na,L ,a n dl o w e rc a l c i u m current amplitude; (3) formation of reactive lipid products (isolevuglandins) in hypertension 5 and AF6; (4) activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor- kappa B and the NLRP3 inﬂammasome 7;( 5 )i n c r e a s ei n mitochondrial and metabolic stress; (6) in ﬂammatory changes; and (7) myo ﬁlament protein degradation, impairing atrial contractility, which may increase throm- boembolism risk. 8 Systemic in ﬂammatory activation, ﬁrst documented with AF after cardiac surgery, 9 has also been associated with nonsurgical AF. 10 NLRP3 knockdown prevented AF inducibility in a mouse model, implicating the NLRP3 inﬂammasome in AF pathophysiology. 11 NLRP3-blocking drugs are in development. 2.3.2.2. Persistence of AF In general, persistence of AF reﬂects the substrate for AF. A suitable substrate for AF has a wavelength (wavelength ¼ refractory period /C2 conduction velocity) that is shorter than the dimensions of the tissue, with heterogenous conduction velocity and/or repolarization duration. Thus, an individual with large, ﬁbrotic, and/or fatty atria is more likely to have persistent AF than one with a normal-sized atria with little interstitial ﬁbrosis or adipose in ﬁltration. Electrophysiologic remodeling is typically a response to persistent AF rather than the trigger. 2.3.3. Role of the Autonomic Nervous System The autonomic nervous system (ANS) has an important role as trigger and substrate (Figure 8).

JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 129 ANS triggers AF The ANS as AF trigger is detailed in several reviews.1-6 Sympathetic efferent stimulation releases noradrenaline, stimulating G-coupled b-adrenergic receptors, enhancing L-type calcium channels, and increasing inward current (automaticity/early afterdepolarization). Delayed after- depolarization occurs via calcium overload and ryanodine-2 receptor dysfunction. Parasympathetic stimulation shortens atrial e ffective refractory period by increasing I KACh (acetyl-choline recep tor mediated inward rectifying potassium channel) activity. Atrial effective refractory period heteroge neity follows the pattern of autonomic innervation. Sympathetic and para- sympathetic activity, alone or combined, can trigger AF. ANS maintains AF Atrial sympathetic and parasympathetic hyperinner- vation and spatial heterogeneity, coupled with electrical fractionation and altered atrial electrophysiology, contribute to substrate. 7-10 Modiﬁable AF risk factors promote ANS dysfunction. 3 AF produces autonomic afferent re ﬂex deﬁciencies elicited by decreased cardiac volume 11,12 and increases sympathetic activity. 13 Afferent abnormalities disrupt blood volume and pressure ho- meostasis. Similar abnormalities to AF were identiﬁed in HF. 14 Afferent ANS dysfunction could link autonomic with anatomic remodeling (atrial dilatation 15), contrib- uting to AF self-perpetuation. 2.4. Genetics Both common forms and familial AF are heritable.1-3 Mul- tiple recent genome-wide association studies have docu- mented >100 loci speci ﬁcf o rA F .4,5 Numerous AF loci appear consistent across multiethnic groups, 5 with some population variation. 6,7 With large genome-wide geno- typed cohorts such as the UK Biobank and the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s( N H L B I’s) Trans Omics for Precision Medicine, the genetic architecture of AF is now emerging. A UK Biobank study identiﬁed TTN loss of function variants in 0.44% of participants, 14% of whom had AF. 8 In a Trans Omics for Precision Medicine study of nearly 1300 participants <66 years of age with AF, 10.1% harbored a disease-associat ed genetic variant in genes associated with inherited c ardiomyopathy or arrhythmia syndromes (most common were TTN, MYH7, MYH6, LMNA,a n dKCNQ1 ) ,a n d6 2 . 8 %h a dv a r i a n t so fu n d e t e r - mined signiﬁcance. Disease-associ ated variants were more prevalent at younger age of AF onset, 16.8% in those<30 years. 9 A smaller study of persons of Hispanic or African American descent reported 7% of persons with AF onset at #66 years of age harbored rare likely pathogenic or pathogenic sequence variants, mostly in myocardial structural proteins and ion channels. 10 2.5. Addressing Health Inequities and Barriers to AF Management Recommendation to Address Health Ine quities and Barriers to AF Management Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 B-NR 1. Patients with AF, regardless of sex1 and gender diversity, race and ethnicity,2 or adverse social de- terminants of health (SDOH), 3,4,* should be equitably offered guideline-directed stroke risk reduction therapies as well as rate or rhythm control strategies and LRFM as indicated to improve quality of life (QOL) and prevent adverse outcomes. *Including lower income, lower education, inadequate or lack of insurance coverage, or rurality.3-5 Synopsis Inequities in AF care and outcomes in individuals who are women, from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (UREGs), 2 or who have adverse SDOH have been documented. 3,4 Sex differences in AF treatment have been described with respect to anticoagulation 6,7 and rhythm control therapy approaches. 7-9 Racial and ethnic differ- ences in clinical presentation, management, and prog- nosis, including stroke, HF, and death, in patients with AF are widely reported. 2,10 To avoid guidelines having the unintended conse- quence of widening inequiti es in clinical care and out- comes in individuals with AF, it is essential to longitudinally measure the receipt of AF GDMT and outcomes at the clinical practice and health system levels strati ﬁed by speci ﬁc populations who have historically experienced inequitable ca re. If inequities are identiﬁed, barriers to GDMT should be eliminated. Data are needed to assess the impact of addressing SDOH in patients with AF on process measures, health care utilization, costs, and clinical outcomes. 11 In other health contexts, there are observational and randomized data 12 that screening and addressing SDOH leads to improved medication adher- ence, 13 risk factor control,14 and clinical outcomes. 15 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Despite the elevated risk of stroke in women and several UREGs, many are less likely to be treated with Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 130 stroke risk reduction therapies.6,7 Although women and individuals from UREGs with AF are more symptomatic and report worse QOL than their counterparts, they also are less likely to be referred to an electrophysiologist 7 and receive catheter ablation. 2,7-9,16 Women are referred for ablation later in the disease course and at older ages than men.7,17,18 These differences or delays in therapy may result in worse outcome given early rhythm control of AF improves outcomes 1,19 in select patients. In addition, in the Catheter Ablation versus Antiarrhythmic Drugs in AF trial, individuals from UREGs treated with catheterablation had a 72% relative reduction in the all-cause mortality rate. 20 Therefore, ensuring timely and equitable referral of women, individuals from UREG, and those with adverse SDOH for rhythm control therapy is important. In patients with AF, indicators of lower socioeconomic status were associated with lower oral anticoagulation rates, 21 lower rate of adherence during direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) initiation, 22 specialty care, 21,23 and less use of cardioversion 4,21 and catheter abla- tion. 4,21,24 Indicators of socioeconomic disadvantages, such as increased risk of hospitalization, 25 stroke, 4,21 HF,4,21,26 a n dd e a t h ,w e r ea l s oa s s o c i a t e dw i t hc o m p l i - c a t i o n si np a t i e n t sw i t hA F .4,21,27 3. SHARED DECISION-MAKING (SDM) IN AF MANAGEMENT Recommendation for SDM in AF Management Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 2b B-R 1. In patients with AF, the use of evidence-based decision aids might be useful to guide stroke reduction therapy treatment decisions throughout the disease c ourse to improve engagement, decisional quality, and patient satisfaction. 1-4 Synopsis There are wide variations in how SDM is implemented in clinical care settings. 5,6 Decision aids may provide standardization of SDM approaches for better informing patients about stroke reduction therapies and improve patient-reported measures but to date have not consis- tently been developed with recommended frameworks, have rarely been tested in systemically disadvantaged populations (low health literacy, UREGs, low socioeco- nomic status, rural geography, older adults), and have had variable impact on adherence and clinical outcomes. 1-8 Ongoing work will measure health and digital literacy and strengthen the evidence for the impact of decision aids on decisional quality, adherence to treatment, and health outcomes. 9 Symptom severity strongly correlates with QOL; thus, mini- mizing symptoms is an essential component of patient- centered AF management decisions. Rhythm control strate- gies improve QOL, particularly when maintenance of sinus rhythm or low AF burden is achieved. 10 Notably, few SDM de- cision aids are focused on rate or rhythm control treatment options, and few have measured QOL as an outcome. 3,5 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Recently, 2 comprehensive reviews of decision aids for stroke reduction therapies were conducted to determine the impact of these tools on patient- reported measures of decisional quality, while considering other important outcomes including oral anticoagulant (OAC) uptake, medication adher- ence, and the effect on bleeding and stroke. 3,4 Most decision aids focused on patient- reported measures, and few underwent rigorous pilot testing or correlated the aid with clinical outcomes, such as stroke and bleeding. Decision aids consistently demonstrate improvement s in patient knowledge. The pooled analysis by Song et al noted lower decisional con ﬂict using decision aids and enhanced OAC uptake (risk ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.05]). 4 Decision aids have historically shown marginal improvement in 3-month measures of adherence, and the 2 largest randomized trials to date showed no improvement in adherence between decision aids and usual care at 1 year. 1,2 There is a paucity of data on the impact of decision aids on stroke, thromboembolic events, or bleeding, and when assessed the bene ﬁt has been minimal or neutral. 4,11 Despite the US Centers for Medicaid & M e d i c a r eS e r v i c e sc o v e r a g edecision requirement for SDM for percutaneous left atrial appendage occlu- sion (LAAO), only 1 tool was identi ﬁed that incor- porated this option ( Table 5 ). 5 JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 131 4. CLINICAL EVALUATION 4.1. Risk Stratiﬁcation and Population Screening There are >20 risk prediction models for incident AF in the community. 1 The most widely replicated risk predic- tion model for newly diagnosed AF is CHARGE-AF (Co- horts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology model for atrial ﬁbrillation; Table 6), 2 while the C 2HEST score (coronary artery disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary diseas e [1 point each]; hyperten- sion [1 point]; elderly [age $75 years, 2 points]; systolic HF [2 points]; thyroid disease[hyperthyroidism, 1 point]) was derived and validated in Asian cohorts (Table 7).3,4 Screening for AF has been investigated, mostly in patients >65 years of age, using various protocols that include both 1-time electrocardiographic recordings, recurring intermittent ECGs (including consumer-based devices), or continuous electrocardiographic external monitors. Most screening t rials have shown higher AF detection using intermittent or continuous electrocar- diographic recordings 5 a n dh i g h e rA Fd e t e c t i o ni np a - tients with higher predicted risk for AF.6 A recent study also showed that an AI algorithm able to risk-stratify a relatively uniform population (eg, older adults at risk for stroke) to detect undiagnosed AF during short-term cardiac monitoring was associated with increased AF. 7 Conversely, mass population screening with a smart- watch app only rarely detected a new diagnosis of AF. 8 Ultimately, for risk strati ﬁcation models and screening programs to be useful, they would need to improve outcomes and be cost-effective. 9 It is not yet established that patients at high risk of developing AF by a validated risk score bene ﬁt from screening and interventions to improve rates of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, and survival.

Basic Clinical Evaluation Synopsis The initial clinical evaluation of the patient with newly diagnosed or suspected AF should be focused on con- ﬁrming the diagnosis and iden tifying relevant clinical factors that will impact management. A targeted history and physical examination should be performed at the initial assessment and repeated during periodic follow- up, especially given the evolving risk of thromboembo- l i s ma n dt h ec a d e n c eo fs y m p t o m si nr e s p o n s et ot h e r a p y (see Section 11 , “Future Research Needs ”). An ECG can assess other electrical abnormalities, including possible substrates such as Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syn- drome, coexisting atrial arrhythmias, as well as abnor- malities that may affec t decision-making in pharmacological management (eg, bradycardia, QT dura- tion). Basic laboratory tests should be performed to determine if other clinically relevant disorders are pre- sent and impact on management, particularly with respect to stroke and bleeding risk. A transthoracic echocardiogram provides information on chamber size, thickness, function, and the presence of valvular pathol- ogy. Additional testing, including multimodality advanced imaging and further ambulatory electrocardio- graphic monitoring, may be pursued based on the results of these initial evaluations. AF itself does not increase the likelihood of myocardial ischemia, ACS or PE, and there- fore routine testing for these disorders in the absence of s i g n so rs y m p t o m si so fn ob e n eﬁt. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. A transthoracic echocardiogram is essential to evaluate chamber size and function, valve function, and right ventricular (RV) pressure. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) impacts decisions for antiarrhythmic drug therapy and whether to prioritize other rhythm control therapies, including catheter ablation. Addi- tionally, strain imaging may suggest an underlying inﬁltrative cardiomyopathy, such as amyloidosis. 1 Echocardiography also provides information on LA size and function. Altered LA compliance is known to be associated with AF 11 and progression toward persistent-type AF. 2 I nam e t a - a n a l y s i s ,A Fr e c u r r e n c e after ablation was associated with a lower LA strain, 3 while LA volume was a stronger predictor of recur- rence after ablation than the characterization of AF as paroxysmal or persistent. 4 Laboratory testing can detect other medical conditions that are associated with AF and would impact therapeutic decision- making, such as CKD,5 liver dysfunction, 6 and hyper- thyroidism. 7,12 Laboratory testing may also reveal electrolyte abnormalities, including from medications such as diuretics. Laboratory testing is also needed to determine stroke risk and bleeding risk factors, which will guide management dec isions. When clinical sus- picion exists, additional testing might be needed to evaluate for potentially related conditions, such as signi ﬁcant valvular disease. 2. The presence of AF itself should not prompt routine protocolized testing for myocardial ischemia, ACS, or PE, in the absence of signs or symptoms to suggest those diseases. A retrospective analysis of asymptom- atic patients with AF compared with age- and sex- matched controls that were referred for myocardial stress imaging found no difference in mean summed stress score or rate of abnormal studies. 8 A retrospec- tive analysis of 1700 asymptomatic AF patients (no chest pain or dyspnea) found that 4.6% had >5% ischemic myocardium, and the yield to detect ischemia that resulted in revascularization was only 0.4%. 9 Among patients suspected of PE, a retrospective anal- ysis showed that the presence of AF did not increase the probability of PE. 10 Certainly, this would not pre- clude from evaluating patients with signs and/or symptoms of ischemia and PE. Recommendations for Basic Clinical Evaluation Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. In patients with newly diagnosed AF, a transthoracic echocardiogram1-4 to assess cardiac structure, laboratory testing to include a complete bloodcount, metabolic panel, and thyroid function,5-7 and when clinical suspicion exists, targeted testing to assess for other medical conditions associated with AF are recommended to determine stroke and bleeding risk factors, as well as underlying conditions that will guide further management. 3: No beneﬁt B-NR 2. In patients with newly diagnosed AF, protocolized testing for ischemia, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and pulmonary embolism (PE) should not routinely be performed to assess the etiology of AF unless there are additional signs or symptoms to indicate those disorders.8-10 JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 133 4.2.2. Rhythm Monitoring Tools and Methods Synopsis Monitoring options for AF include a standard 12-lead ECG, continuously recording o r loop-recording electro- cardiographic monitors using separate electrodes or as patches, implantable cardiac monitors (sometimes referred to as implantable looprecorders), cardiac rhythm management devices with an atrial lead (eg, pacemakers and de ﬁbrillators), handheld ECGs, and smartwatches. Photoplethysmography has been used to infer AF from irregular pulse patterns usin g a variety of devices, pre- dominately smartphone cameras 14 and smartwatches. 15-18 Electrocardiographic monitors often deploy automated algorithms for AF detection, but due to variable accu- racy, 1-5 the initial diagnosis should rely on a health care professional ’s examination of the electrocardiographic tracing. Although photople thysmography monitors may alert individuals to obtain an electrocardiographic tracing, it is not suf ﬁciently reliable to establish an AF diag- nosis. 14-18 AF detected from an atrial lead has been vali- dated versus surface ECGs6,7 and independently predicts stroke. 8,9 RCTs have demonstrated that implantable car- diac monitors exhibit the highest sensitivity in detecting AF compared with external ambulatory monitors, likely related to the longer duration of monitoring. 10,11 Auto- mated algorithms to analyze electrocardiographic devices have generally been found to be suf ﬁciently reliable to infer the frequency, duration, and burden of AF among those with an AF diagnosis. 1,4,5,12 Ar a n d o m i z e dt r i a l showed that a handheld elect rocardiographic monitor resulted in earlier detection of recurrent AF.13 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Although automated algorithms in various devices are generally reliable, health care professional overread of electrocardiographic tracings remains necessary given the imperfect test characteristics of those algorithms.1-5 Similarly, while algorithms utilizing photo- plethysmography signals (derived using smartphones or smartwatches) to infer ir regular heart rates can discriminate AF from normal sinus rhythm, these are not sufﬁciently reliable to establish an AF diagnosis. 14-18 2. Cardiac rhythm devices with an atrial lead have been shown to detect AF validated against conventional surface electrocard iographic tracings. 6-8 In addition, both the presence and duration of AF detected solely by these devices predict stroke in a manner that would be expected of AF. 8,9 It is still essential that the intra- cardiac tracings are reviewed for conﬁrmation because false-positives are possible. The duration of AF that mandates intervention with anticoagulation will be discussed in Section 6.4.1 (“Oral Anticoagulation for Device-Detected Atrial High-Rate Episodes Among Patients Without a Previous Diagnosis of AF”). 3. The more frequent and longer monitoring for AF is deployed, the greater the sensitivity in detecting Recommendations for Rhythm Monitoring Tools and Methods Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. Among individuals without a known history of AF, it is recommended that an initial AF diagnosis be made by a clinician using visual interpretation of the electrocardiographic signals, regardless of the type of rhythm or monitoring device. 1-5 1 B-NR 2. In patients with an intracardiac rhythm device capable of a diagnosis of AF, such as from an atrial pacemaker lead, a diagnosis of AF should only be made after it is visually conﬁrmed by reviewing intracardiac tracings to exclude signal artifacts and other arrhythmias. 6-9 2a B-R 3. For patients who have had a systemic thromboembolic event without a known history of AF and in whom maximum sensitivity to detect AF is sought, an implantable cardiac monitor is reasonable. 10,11 2a B-NR 4. Among patients with a diagnosis of AF, it is reasonable to infer AF frequency, duration, and burden using automated algorithms available from electrocardiog raphic monitors, implantable cardiac monitors, and cardiac rhythm devices with an atrial lead, recognizing that periodic review can be required to exclude other arrhythmias. 1,4,5,12 2a B-R 5. Among patients with AF in whom cardiac monitoring is advised, it is reasonable to recommend use of a consumer-accessible electrocardiographic device that provides a high-quality tracing to detect recurrences. 13 Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 134 AF.10,19 Randomized trials, predominately among cryptogenic stroke patients, have revealed that implantable cardiac monitors exhibit the highest sensitivity in detecting AF in view of extended moni- toring periods compared with external monitors. 10,11 4. It is often not feasible to manually review all electro- cardiographic strips from various monitoring devices, either due to inaccessibility or time and resource con- straints on health care professionals. Although vari- ability in accuracy across different devices may be present, the validity demonstrated in automated al- gorithms is generally suf ﬁcient to infer frequency, duration, and burden of AF using electrocardiographic devices such as continuously wearable monitors, implantable cardiac monitors, and cardiac rhythm de- vices with an atrial lead. 1,4,5,12 5. Cardiac monitoring may be advised to AF patients for various reasons, such as for detecting recurrences, screening, or response to therapy. Among patients with AF who are undergoing cardioversion or AF ablation, a single-center, randomized trial demonstrated that use of a self-administered handheld ECG resulted in earlier detection of recurrent AF 13 and possibly improvement in survey-determined AF-related QOL20 compared with usual care. 5. LIFESTYLE AND RISK FACTOR MODIFICATION (LRFM) FOR AF MANAGEMENT 5.1. Primary Prevention Recommendation for Primary Prevention Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 B-NR 1. Patients at increased risk of AF should receive comprehensive guideline-directed LRFM for AF, targeting obesity, 1 physical inactivity, 2 unhealthy alcohol consumption, 3 smoking, 4 diabetes, 5 and hypertension. 6 Synopsis The clinical, family history, and genetic risk factors for AF are well established ( Table 3 ), and risk prediction models (Section 4.1 , “Risk Strati ﬁcation and Population Screening ”) for AF have been reported and replicated.7-9 Multiple reports have established that maintenance of optimal risk factors and ideal cardiovascular health are associated with substantially reduced risk of AF 10,11 onset and complications ( Section 5, “Lifestyle and Risk Factor Modiﬁcation [LRFM] for AF Management ”). To reduce risk of AF onset, individuals in the general population, particularly those at increas ed risk of AF, should receive comprehensive integrated LRFM, including maintenance of ideal weight and weight loss if overweight or obese 1,12; pursue a physically active lifestyle, 2 particularly if sedentary; receive smoking cessation counseling and/or medications 4;m o d e r a t e(#1 standard alcoholic drink/day) or abstain from alcohol and avoidance of binge drinking3; control diabetes 5; and control BP in accordance with GDMT. 6,13 T h e r ei sa l s oa na s s o c i a t i o no fc a n n a b i s , cocaine, methamphetamine, or opiate use with increased incidence of AF. 14 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Most cardiovascular risk factors are associated with increased risk of new-onset AF. Observational studies have demonstrated that obesity and physical inactivity each independently increase the risk of newly diagnosed AF. 1,2,12,15-20 However, caution should be considered in pursuing years of regular, high-volume ( $3 h/day) high-intensity endurance training given observational data linking it with i n c r e a s e dA Fr i s k 21-23 in men and similar “J” curve risk curve observed for high or vigorous activity in both men and women in another study. 24 Alcohol consumption enhances the risk of AF in a fairly linear fashion, with clear evidence that binge drinking heightens the risk. 3,25-29 Uncertainty persists regarding harms or bene ﬁts of no more than 1 reg- ular drink per day. 28,29 Self-reported, 4 biomarker- veriﬁed,30 and genetically predicted 31 smoking is associated with increased risk, and smoking cessa- tion is associated with decreased risk of incident AF.4 T h ep r e s e n c eo fe i t h e rt y p e1o rt y p e2d i a - betes increases AF risk, 5,32 with evidence that worse glucose control correlates with a higher probability of developing AF. 33 Hypertension is the risk factor with the highest attributable risk for AF 10;i n t e n s i v e BP control lowers the risk of incident AF in obser- vational and randomized data. 6 Effective strategies to manage risk factors and prevent CVD have been reported elsewhere. 12,13 JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 135 5.2.

Weight Loss in Individuals Who Are Overweight or Obese Recommendation for Weight Loss in Individuals Who Are Overweight or Obese Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 B-R 1. In patients with AF who are overweight or obese (with body mass index [BMI]>27 kg/m2), weight loss is recommended, with an ideal target of at least 10% weight loss to reduce AF symptoms, burden, recur- rence, and progression to persistent AF.1-4 Synopsis Obesity is associated with the development and pro- gression of AF. 5 It results in direct changes to the atrial myocardium forming the substrate for AF.6-8 In addition, obesity is also associated with several comorbidities that have been independently associated with the develop- ment of AF. 9,10 Obesity has a signiﬁcant adverse impact on attempts to maintain sinus rhythm, with each 5-unit in- crease in BMI being associated with a 10% and 13% greater risk of postoperative and postablation AF, respec- tively. 5,11,12 Management of weight is important in the prevention and treatment of AF. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In an RCT in overweight and obese individuals with BMI >27 kg/m2 and AF, weight loss, as part of a compre- hensive LRFM program, was associated with reduction in arrhythmia symptoms, recurrence, and burden. 1 Observational studies demonstrated graded responses commensurate with the degree of weight loss, with achievement of at least 10% weight loss associated with greater maintenance of sinus rhythm, 2 improved abla- tion outcomes, 3 and reversal of AF type. 4 In observa- tional studies, bariatric surgery in Class III obese individuals (BMI $40 kg/m 2)w i t hA Fw a sa s s o c i a t e d with improved sinus rhythm maintenance after catheter ablation 13,14 and reversal of AF type. 15 The greater number of risk factors managed associated with likeli- hood of maintaining sinus rhythm. 16 However, a small observational study in individuals with obesity (BMI $30 kg/m 2) with long-lasting persistent AF observed no difference in symptoms or sinus rhythm maintenance despite signiﬁcant weight loss, suggesting that there may be extreme substrates in which a weight loss strategy may not be effective. 17 Structured programs with regular review of progress facilitate achievement of weight loss and appear essential, as demonstrated by inability to reduce AF burden in a small RCT that achieved only 4.5% weight loss in the intervention arm. 5.2.2. Physical Fitness Recommendation for Physical Fitness Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 B-R 1. In individuals with AF,* moderate-to-vigorous exercise training to a target of 210 minutes per week is recommended to reduce AF symptoms1-3 and burden,2,3 increase maintenance of sinus rhythm,3-5 increase functional capacity, and improve QOL. 3,5,6 *In patients without AF related to excessive exercise training. Synopsis Randomized trials provide evidence that prescribed aerobic exercise intervent ions may reduce arrhythmia burden in those with nonpermanent AF 2 and improve functional capacity and health-related QOL in both per- manent 1,6 and nonpermanent AF. 2 In the ACTIVE-AF (An Exercise and Physical Activity Program in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) study, an exercise intervention combining home and supervised aerobic exercise over 6 months resulted in greater freedom from arrhythmia recurrence, reduced burden, and improved QOL. 3 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In patients with nonpermanent AF, aerobic exercise training may contribute to a reduction in AF burden and improve maintenance of sinus rhythm. 2-5 Aerobic ex- ercise interventions reduce severity of AF symptoms, increase functional capacity, and improve health- related QOL among patients with both nonpermanent and permanent AF. 1,3,6 Initiation of or continuing reg- ular exercise after development of AF was associated with a lower risk of HF and mortality in a population- Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 136 based cohort study.7 Exercise training should be mod- erate- to vigorous-intensi ty aerobic exercise, with a t a r g e to f2 1 0m i n u t e sp e rw e e k ,a n ds h o u l db ep r e - scribed to reduce the frequency and duration of AF episodes, while improving cardiorespiratory ﬁtness and symptom severity. 3 Exercise prescription may be further modi ﬁed to patient comorbidities, such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. 4 Caution should be applied to ensure adequate ventricular rate control during exercise training and absence of atrial myopathy related to excessive exercise training. To date, there is little evidence that high-intensity aerobic exercise may be favorable over moderate-intensity activities, 8 and extreme levels of exercise have been associated with higher incidence of AF. 9,10 Exercise training may be delivered as a stand-alone intervention or as a component of multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improves QOL and functional capacity among patients with AF un- dergoing ablation, 11,12 although available studies have not been adequately powered to assess AF-speci ﬁc outcomes, such as arrhythmia recurrence. 13 There is mixed evidence for a reduction in hospitalization or all- cause mortality with exercise training or exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation. 12,14,15 5.2.3. Smoking Cessation Recommendation for Smoking Cessation Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 B-NR 1. Patients with a history of AF who smoke cigarettes should be strongly advised to quit smoking and should receive GDMT for tobacco cessation1,2 to mitigate increased risks of AF-related cardiovascular compli- cations and other adverse outcomes. 3-6 Synopsis Observational data support that cigarette smoking in individuals with AF is associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes and death and that individuals with AF who quit smoking are less likely to develop stroke or die. Despite the bene ﬁts of smoking cessation, individuals with AF are less likely to receive smoking cessation management than counterparts without AF. 7,8 Patients with AF should be strongly advised to quit cigarette smoking 9 and should receive GDMT for tobacco cessation, including behavioral interventions 10,11 and pharmacotherapy. 2 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In individuals with AF, cigarette smoking was associ- ated with poorer outcomes. For individuals who have undergone AF catheter ablation, current cigarette smoking was associated with increased risk for AF recurrence. 12,13 Cigarette smoking was associated with less time in therapeutic range for patients on warfarin.14 Although some heterogeneity exists, the preponderance of studies have reported that individuals with AF who smoked cigarettes had increased risks of stroke, 3,4 HF,5 hospitalization, 6 and death.6,15 Of concern, studies have reported that individuals with AF (versus those without) were less likely to receive smoking cessation interventions. 7,8 Observational studies suggest that c o m p a r e dw i t hc u r r e n ts m o k e r s ,i n d i v i d u a l sw i t hA F who quit smoking after AF diagnosis were less likely to experience CVD, 3 stroke, 3,16 and all-cause mortality. 16 5.2.4. Alcohol Consumption Recommendation for Alcohol Consumption Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 B-R 1. Patients with AF seeking a rhythm-control strategy should minimize or eliminate alcohol consumption to reduce AF recurrence and burden.1-3 Synopsis Among patients with a diagnosis of AF, randomized trials have demonstrated a reduction in AF burden on assignment to abstinence, 1 that alcohol acutely changes human electrophysiology in a fashion that renders the atria more prone to ﬁbrillate, 2 and suggest that avoiding alcohol can reduce the risk of a near-term AF event.3 Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. Among patients with AF, a case-crossover study revealed a higher risk of a discrete AF episode hours after objectively con ﬁrmed alcohol consumption. 4 In the context of a structured comprehensive management of risk factors, alcohol abstinence 1 or reduction to #3 JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 137 standard drinks per week has been demonstrated to reduce AF symptoms,5 AF burden,6,7 and progression of AF from paroxysmal to persistent.8 5.2.5.

Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. A randomized trial of caffeine failed to show any dif- ference in postoperative AF risk, 1 and paroxysmal AF patients experienced no detectable difference in AF episodes when exposing themselves to versus avoiding caffeine in randomized N-of-1 trials. 2 Longitudinal, observational studies have generally found that caffeine consumed in usual amounts is either associated with no heightened risk 3-6 or a reduced risk of incident AF.3,5,7-9Also, Mendelian randomization studies exam- ining caffeine metabolism-related genetic variants as instrumental-variable surro gates of caffeine consump- tion have not shown either a harmful or protective ef- fect related to incident AF. 8,11 Several case reports have described a relationship between excessive consump- tion of caffeine (involving overdoses or highly caffein- ated energy drinks) 12,13 a n dA Fi ny o u n g ,h e a l t h y individuals. Individuals s hould not begin or increase their caffeine consumption with the intent of reducing their AF risk. Patients often report that caffeine triggers their AF,10,14 although this has neither been supported by nor exten- sively studied in an objective manner. Current studies cannot exclude the possibility of individual-level idiosyn- cratic relationships between caffeine and AF. It is also possible that caffeine exacerbates symptoms of AF, or causes similar symptoms of palpitations, or enhances heart rhythm awareness. 5.2.6. Diet and Dietary Supplementation Promoting a healthy diet is an effective strategy for prevention of cardiovascular disease. The evidence per- taining to the prevention of AF using dietary supple- ments is inconsistent, complicated by substantial misclassi ﬁcation and difﬁculties controlling for potential confounding factors associated with dietary interventions. Several studies have evaluated the role of omega-3 fatty acids and AF, demonstrating an inverse relation- ship between plasma omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels and prevalent AF. 1,2 However, with supple- mentation there has been no effect or a potential for greater AF. 3-7 Although vitamin D supplementation is not useful on a population basis, 8,9 its use in the peri- operative period in de ﬁcient individuals reduces AF. 10 Similarly, ascorbic acid has been bene ﬁcial in reducing postoperative AF in some studies, although not uniformly. 11 The importance of weight management on AF symp- toms, burden, and recurrence is increasingly recog- nized, 12,13 leading to various dietary interventions. Although evidence on diets is s till evolving, analyses of the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study caution using low-carbohydrate diets, which were found to increase the risk of incident AF, regardless of the type of protein or fat used to replace carbohydrate. 14 5.2.7. Diabetes AF and diabetes are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and sudden death. 1 In patients with diabetes, vascular mortality was lower in patients treated with DOACs compared with warfarin. 2 In patients with AF and diabetes undergoing catheter ablation, optimal glycemic control preablation may lessen the risk of AF recurrence postablation. 3 Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 138 5.2.8. Treatment of Hypertension Synopsis Renal denervation and mineralocorticoid receptor an- tagonists (MRAs) have been associated with decreased AF burden in clinical trials. 1,2 The only randomized trial singularly targeting BP control as a mechanism to reduce the recurrence of AF8 showed no signiﬁcant difference in the primary outcome of recurrent symptomatic atrial arrhythmia beyond 3 months ’ postablation among the 2 groups. However, clinical trials of integrated compre- hensive LRFM programs in conjunction with rhythm c o n t r o lt h e r a p i e sf o rA Fh a v er e s u l t e di nl o n g e r arrhythmia-free survival and decreased AF burden. 3,5,9 Among patients with AF, treating elevated BP to guideline-directed goals red uces major cardiovascular events. 9 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In patients with AF, treatment of hypertension should aim for current BP guide lines to reduce stroke, bleeding, and other adverse outcomes. 5,10 An RCT of patients with paroxysmal AF and hypertension noted fewer recurrences among participants treated with renal denervation and pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) compared with PVI alone. 2 Randomized studies of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for hyperten- sion have been shown to reduce AF burden, and ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers have been associated with lower AF incidence in secondary analyses of RCTs (see Section 8.3.4 , “Upstream Ther- apy”). In addition, several integrated LRFM programs that have resulted in a decrease in BP have been asso- ciated with a decreased recurrence of AF. 3,11 The SMAC (Substrate Modi ﬁcation With Aggressive Blood Pressure Control) AF trial randomized hypertensive patients scheduled for AF ablation to standard or aggres- sive BP treatment with a systolic BP target of 120 or 140 mm Hg. 8 No signiﬁcant difference was shown in recurrent symptomatic atrial arrhythmia beyond 3 months post- ablation (median follow-up, 14 months), and this is the only RCT to date singularly targeting BP control as a mechanism to reduce AF recurrence. 8 Post hoc analyses of DOAC clinical trials to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with AF have consistently found lower rates of stroke in patients with controlled BP. 6,7 5.2.9. Sleep Recommendation for the Treatment of Hypertension Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 B-NR 1. For patients with AF and hypertension, optimal BP control is recommended to reduce AF recurrence and AF-related cardiovascular events. 1-7 Recommendation for Sleep Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 2b B-NR 1. Among patients with AF, it may be reasonable to screen for obstructive sleep apnea, given its high prevalence in patients with AF, although the role oftreatment of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) to maintain sinus rhythm is uncertain. 1-13 Synopsis SDB is a risk factor for the development of incident AF, and more severe SDB acutely increases the risk of a discrete AF episode. 14-18 Independent of SDB, poor sleep quality is associated with an increased risk of developing incident AF. 19-21 When formal testing for SDB is used, the disease is frequently observed in>20% of patients with an AF diagnosis. 1-5 Observational studies suggest that treat- ment of SDB may reduce the risk of AF recurrence and AF burden, but RCTs have not been adequately powered to reveal a relationship between treating SDB and reduced AF.6-13 Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. The prevalence of SDB is remarkably and consistently high in patients with AF (generally substantially >20% and sometimes >50% regardless of the type of AF population assessed), is often undetected, and, as con- ventional symptoms of SDB may be absent, may require formal study to establish a diagnosis of SDB. 1-5,11 JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 139 Multiple observational studies have described fewer recurrences of AF and a reduction in AF burden, including after cardioversion and catheter ablation procedures, among those undergoing treatment for SDB c o m p a r e dw i t ht h o s en o tt r e a t e df o rt h e i rS D B . 6-11 ,22 However, small trials ran domizing patients with AF and SDB treatment versus usual care have not shown signi ﬁcant differences in AF burden or AF recurrence, including after cardioversion or PVI ablation, 12,13,22 although studies tended to exclude patients who might beneﬁt most from SDB treatment (eg, those who had more symptomatic sleep apnea [Epworth Sleepiness Scale score >10 or 15], severe cardiovascular disease [LVEF <40% or 45%], or severe obesity). 5.2.10. Comprehensive Care Recommendations for Comprehensive Care Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1A 1. Patients with AF should receive comprehensive care addressing guideline-directed LRFM, AF symptoms, risk of stroke, and other associated medical conditionsto reduce AF burden, progression, or consequences.1-3 2a B-R 2. In patients with AF, use of clinical care pathways, such as nurse-led AF clinics, is reasonable to promote comprehensive, team-based care and to enhance adherence to evidence-based therapies for AF and associated conditions. 4-6 Synopsis Almost all patients with AF have multiple conditions that either increase AF risk or are exacerbated by AF. Pa- tients with AF are also at risk of developing thromboem- bolism, stroke, and HF, so a comprehensive approach tailored to the needs of the individual patient should improve outcomes. Randomized trials have shown that interventions aimed at AF riskfactors, such as alcohol use, overweight, and HF, reduce AF burden. Clinical care pathways and algorithms for AF management, including LRFM, have shown promise in randomized trials through coordinating care and facilitating comprehensive AF management. Although comprehensive ca r eo ft h em u l t i p l ec o n d i - tions associated with AF is logical, it is unclear whether integrated care by a multidisciplinary team leads to better outcomes than comprehensive care by a single clinician applying an evidence-based AF clinical care algorithm or pathway. Nevertheless, coordination of care among mul- tiple clinicians should also improve care, even though it has not been evaluated rigorously. 7 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Randomized trials have shown the ef ﬁcacy of many individual components of patient-centered care for AF, as discussed earlier in this section. Several randomized and nonrandomized studies h ave utilized comprehen- sive programs for patients with AF. 2,8,9 The RACE 3 (Rate Control versus Electrical cardioversion for persistent atrial ﬁbrillation) trial 3 found that multifac- eted treatment for patients with AF and early HF (with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, statins, ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs], and cardiac rehabilitation) improved maintenance of sinus rhythm. 2. Various clinical care pathways, algorithms, and elec- tronic clinical decision su pport systems for the care of patients with AF have been tested in clinical trials, with mixed results. Care provided by specialty nurses using a clinical support system aimed at enhancing adherence to guideline-directed therapies improved cardiovascu- lar outcomes in a single center study 4 but not in the subsequent multicenter RACE 4 trial, where results were associated with experience of the center, although adherence to guideline-based recommendations was still greatly improved. 10 In a cluster randomized trial of elderly patients with AF where integrated care inter- vention consisting of (a) quarterly AF check-ups by trained nurses in primary care, also focusing on comorbidities, (b) monitoring of anticoagulation ther- apy in primary care, and ﬁnally (c) easy-access avail- ability of consultations from cardiologists and anticoagulation clinics, the patients assigned to inte- grated care experienced a 45% reduction in all-cause mortality when compared with usual care. 11 In another study (SAFETY [Standard versus Atrial Fibrillation speci ﬁc management study]), a posthospital discharge management program speci ﬁc to AF was associated with proportionately more days alive and out of hos- pital but not prolonged event-free survival relative to standard management. 12 On the other hand, data on technology-based clinical decision support systems are mixed, with a reduction in stroke and thromboembo- lism in the mAF-App 2 (Mobile Health Technology for Improved Screening and Optimized Integrated Care in Atrial Fibrillation) trial 5 and improved anticoagulation use in the CDS-AF (clinical decision support tool for Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 140 stroke prevention) trial, 6 but no signiﬁcant effect on primary outcomes in 3 other randomized trials. 13-15 Educational interventions for both providers and pa- tients can improve use of anticoagulation. 16 6. PREVENTION OF THROMBOEMBOLISM 6.1. Risk Stratiﬁcation Schemes Recommendations for Risk Strati ﬁcation Schemes Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. Patients with AF should be evaluated for their annual risk of thromboembolic events using a validated clinical risk score, such as CHA2DS2-VASc. 1-4 1 B-NR 2. Patients with AF should be evaluated for factors that speciﬁcally indicate a higher risk of bleeding, such as previous bleeding and use of drugs that increase bleeding risk, in order to identify possible interventions to prevent bleeding on anticoagulation. 5-7 2a C-LD 3. Patients with AF at intermediate annual risk of thromboembolic events by risk scores (eg, equivalent to CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 in men or 2 in women), who remain uncertain about the beneﬁto fa n t i - coagulation, can bene ﬁt from consideration of factors that might modify their risk of stroke to help inform the decision. * 3: No Beneﬁt B-NR 4. In patients who are deemed at high risk for stroke, bleeding risk scores should not be used in isolation to determine eligibility for oral anticoagulation but instead to identify and modify bleeding risk factors and to inform medical decision-making. 8-10 *Factors may include AF burden or other features inTable 3. Synopsis Patients with AF have an increased risk of stroke that varies widely among individuals. Several risk scores based on clinical factors have been developed. 1-3 Risk scores should be evaluated using accepted criteria11: their ability to discriminate between high- and low-risk individuals (eg, as assessed by the c-index), their accurate calibration to actual risk levels, and their validation in independent populations. A patient’s absolute risk of stroke is central to recommendations about anticoagulation and can be characterized as low ( w< 1%/y), intermediate ( w1t o w2%/y), and high ( w>2%/y). Currently used risk scores discriminate moderately well between patients at higher and lower risk yet can greatly overestimate or underesti- mate absolute risk levels 4 in different populations. Cur- rent risk scores may be inaccurate because they omit other factors that alter risk of stroke, especially characteristics of AF 12-14 ; consequently, risk scores should be calibrated against the actual annual rates of stroke in the target population to assure an accurate, unbiased risk prediction. Newer risk scores may modestly improve risk discrimina- tion (c-index) compared with CHA 2DS2-VASc and may offer potential advantages in speciﬁcp o p u l a t i o n s(Table 8). On- line calculators are available for the ATRIA (Anti- coagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation), 1 CHA2DS2-VASc, 2 and GARFIELD-AF 3 (Global Anticoagu- lant Registry in the Field-Atrial Fibrillation) risk scores. Anticoagulation increases the risk of bleeding, so patients with AF are generally evaluated for bleeding risk as part of SDM about anticoagulation. Currently used bleeding risk scores— HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio [INR], elderly [age$65 years], drugs/alcohol concomitantly]), 5 HEMORR2HAGES (hepatic or renal disease, ethanol abuse, malignancy, older age [$75 years], reduced platelet count or function, re-bleeding risk, hypertension [uncontrolled], anemia, genetic factors, excessive fall risk, stroke), 6 and ATRIA (Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation: anemia, renal disease, elderly [age $75 years], any prior bleeding, hypertension)7— discriminate poorly between patients with and without bleeding 15 and include many nonspeciﬁc factors that predict an increased risk of stroke as well as an increased risk of bleeding (eg, age, hypertension, renal disease, and previous stroke). Assessment of factors that speciﬁcally predict an increased risk of bleeding without predicting an increased risk of stroke is more helpful when balancing risks and ben- eﬁts of anticoagulation. Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. Several risk scores based on clinical factors have been developed 1-3; in general, risk discrimination is improved by including more predictors (eg, CHA 2DS2- VASc improved on the original CHADS 2 2 [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >75 years, diabetes, stroke/transient ischemia a ttack/thromboembolism] by adding additional risk factors and age categories). However, the absolute risk associated with any partic- ular score level varies widely across populations; among 15 cohort studies, patients with a CHA 2DS2-VASc JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 141 score of 2 had annual rates of stroke that ranged from low to high: <1% in 4 cohorts, 1% to 2% in 6 cohorts, and >2% in 5 cohorts, 4 although higher scores were associated with higher stroke risk in each cohort (Figure 9). The CHA 2DS2-VASc score is considered the most validated score, most therapies have used that score to prove ef ﬁcacy, and thus CHA 2DS2-VASc is generally the preferred score. Yet, despite its extensive use, CHA 2DS2-VASc has shown suboptimal perfor- mance in selected populations, such as those with renal disease, prompting the creation of other scores. Newer risk scores, such as the ATRIA 1,16,17 and GAR- FIELD-AF 3,18 scores, modestly improve risk discrimi- nation (c-index) compared with CHA 2DS2-VASc, but their calibration and risk reclassi ﬁcation performance has not been as rigorously evaluated. A recent meta- analysis reported that 19 risk scores, 329 external val- idations, and 76 risk score updates have been conducted to predict ischemic stroke in patients with AF.19 Potential differences of the most studied risk scores are listed inTable 9. Some potential advantages of other scores, for example, the GARFIELD-AF score, includes mortality and bleeding risk to facilitate dis- cussion with patients in a more comprehensive way. Also, when uncertainty exists, a score such as GARFIELD-AF adds additional variables to consider, such as smoking status, renal disease, and dementia. This guideline does not intend to preclude the future development of more accurate scores for stratifying patients. 2. Clinical decisions surrounding stroke prevention therapy in patients with AF must balance the risks of ischemic stroke, the risks of bleeding with treatment, net clinical beneﬁt, and patient preferences. The most studied bleeding risk scores (HAS-BLED, 5 HEMORR2HAGES,6 and ATRIA7) discriminate poorly between patients with and FIGURE 9 Rates of Stroke by Stroke Risk Score Levels in Different Cohorts Overall stroke rate in atrialﬁbrillation cohorts in order of descending stroke rate (events per 100 person-years).

Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 142 without bleeding 20 (c-index 0.58 to 0.59 in a French nationwide study 21). These scores are problematic to use in clinical decision-making because they incorpo- rate several clinical factors that increase the risks of both stroke and bleeding (eg, age, hypertension, renal disease, and previous stroke), which makes it difﬁcult to balance the bene ﬁts and risks of anticoagulation because the same risk factors also predict higher risk of stroke. Consideration of factors that speci ﬁcally indi- cate a higher risk of bleeding without predicting higher risk of stroke (eg, previous bleeding, anemia, and certain medications) may better inform decision- making about the balance of bene ﬁts and harms ex- pected from anticoagulation. Assessment of risk factors speciﬁc for bleeding may suggest interventions to reduce bleeding risk, such as discontinuing antiplatelet medications or nonsteroidal anti-in ﬂammatory medi- cations or the use of LAAO devices. 10 3. The decision to treat with OACs for stroke prevention in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc of 1 (CHA2DS2-VASc of 2 in women) may at times require additional discussion with patients as the strength or recommendation is less robust (2a), and often patients might be more reluc- tant. Also, the 1-point-concept of risk estimation in the subgroup of patients with a CHA 2DS2-VASc score of 1 has shown to be simplistic because the magnitude of risk for each factor is heterogeneous and because data have shown a wide range of risk depending on the studied cohort. 22 Thus, as part of SDM discussions with TABLE 8 Three Validated Risk Models for Stroke Risk Factor CHA 2DS2-VASc 2 ATRIA 1 GARFIELD 3 Age $85 y 6 0.98 Age $75 y 2 5 0.59 Age 65-74 y 1 3 0.20 Female sex 1 1 Hypertension 1 1 0.16 Renal disease 1 0.35 Diabetes 1 1 0.21 Current smoking 0.48 Congestive heart failure 1 1 0.23 Previous stroke or TIA 2 2 –8* 0.80 Vascular disease 1 0.20 Dementia 0.51 Previous bleeding 0.30 Proteinuria 1 Low risk score 0 0 –50 –0.89 Intermediate risk score 1 6 0.90 –1.59 High risk score $27 –15 $1.60 C-index (11) 0.63 0.66 - C-index (13) 0.67 - 0.71 *8 points if age<65 y; 4 points if age 65-74 y; 2 points if age 75-84 y; and 3 points if $85 y.

Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 144 demonstrated to inﬂuence stroke risk, yet it is unclear how to incorporate them into clinical practice. 12 Antithrombotic treatmen t with DOACs seems to offer a superior net-bene ﬁtw i t hr e g a r dt op r e v e n t i o no f thromboembolic events and the risk of major bleeding compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Consid- eration of these additional factors may inform decision-making for patien ts with an intermediate risk of stroke who remain uncertain on deciding anticoagulation. 4. Unless an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation is present, bleeding risk scores have limitation in clin- ical decision-making because the most commonly used scores (HAS-BLED, 5 HEMORR 2HAGES, 6 and ATRIA7)a r e based on several clinical factors that indicate higher risks of both stroke and bleeding, and patients with higher risk of bleeding also tend to have a higher risk of stroke. Furthermore, a bl eeding risk score cannot be interpreted in isolation because it does not assess the net clinical beneﬁt of anticoagulation or balance the risk of bleeding against the risk of stroke. Population-based studies suggest that the beneﬁts of stroke prevention with oral anticoagulation generally outweigh the risks of bleeding, even in patients determined to be at high risk for bleeding. 8,9 Decision-making about oral anti- coagulation should be based on consideration of both beneﬁts and harms, not by using bleeding risk scores in isolation, and the best utility of these scores may be identifying potential modifying risk factors. 8,9 6.2. Risk-Based Selection of Oral Anticoagulation: Balancing Risks and Beneﬁts Recommendations for Risk-Based Selection of Or al Anticoagulation: Balancing Risks and Bene ﬁts Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-R 1. In patients diagnosed with AF who have an estimated annual risk of stroke or thromboembolic events ‡2%, selection of therapy to reduce the risk of stroke should be based on the risk of thrombo- embolism, regardless of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent. 1-3 1 B-NR 2. In patients with AF at risk for stroke, reevaluation of the need for and choiceof stroke risk reduction therapy at periodic intervals is recommended to reassess stroke and bleeding risk, net clinical beneﬁt, and proper dosing. 4,5 Synopsis Prevention of stroke is important in patients with AF to maximize survival, health, and QOL. Selection of stroke risk reduction therapy should be guided by the patient’s risk of stroke, risks of bleeding with therapy, and their individual preferences. When considering stroke preven- tion therapy, the risk of stroke should inform the decision regardless of the pattern of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent). All decisions regarding stroke prevention therapy should be periodi- cally reassessed since a patient ’s risk, eligibility, and preferences can change over time. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Although the risk of stroke and systemic embolism and all-cause mortality are increased in persons with more persistent forms of AF, selection of stroke prevention t h e r a p ys h o u l db eb a s e do nt h er i s ko fs t r o k ea n dn o t the pattern of AF. Treatment effects with oral anti- coagulation are consistent across AF patterns (parox- ysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, or permanent) in trials of stroke prevention therapy. 1-3 2. AF is a lifelong condition and, thus, patient character- i s t i c s ,r i s kf a c t o r s ,a n dn e tc l i n i c a lb e n eﬁt can and often will change over time.4 In long-term follow-up, stroke risk increases due to age and accumulation of other risk factors. 6 Physiologic factors that impact stroke pre- vention therapy also change over time and can have important implications for proper medication dosing and patient safety. 5 Typically, periodic assessment should be performed once a year but might need to be performed more frequently in the context of changes in clinical status, such as reduction in renal function or development of additional risk factors.

Oral Anticoagulants Vitamin K Antagonists Since the 1950s, warfarin was used as aﬁrst-line ther- apy until DOACs came into practice. A narrow therapeutic window based on international normalized ratios (INRs), frequent monitoring, more frequent drug interactions (mainly through CYP2C9), dietary restrictions, and low clinical safety proﬁle affected the routine use of warfarin in practice. Because of affordability issues of DOACs for some patients with AF, warfarin is still an appropriate OAC due to its lower cost for patients who cannot afford DOACs. About 21% of patients with nonvalvular AF were still receiving warfarin, while the rest received DOACs in the ﬁrst quarter of 2017. 1 Warfarin remains the ﬁrst-line therapy in patients with AF and moderate-severe rheu- matic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves. Clinical studies show that the target INR is between 2 and 3, and risk of bleeding becomes mostly apparent when INR ex- ceeds 4. OAC use in special populations will be discussed in separate sections. Direct oral anticoagulants DOACs were developed to address the disadvantages of warfarin and are currently recommended as the ﬁrst-line therapy over warfarin in patients with AF (except moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve recipients) in this guid eline. All 4 pivotal clinical trials comparing individual DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) with warfarin showed supe- riority or noninferiority to warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with AF except for moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve. 2-5 They also showed signi ﬁcantly lower risks of major bleeding in the apixaban, dabigatran 110 mg twice daily group, and edoxaban 30 mg or 60 mg daily dose groups compared with the warfarin group or nonsigni ﬁ- cant differences in major bleeding between dabigatran 150 mg twice daily group or the rivaroxaban group and warfarin. All DOAC groups showed signi ﬁcantly lower risks of intracranial hemo rrhage (ICH) compared with warfarin. Gastrointestinal bleeding risks were signi ﬁ- cantly higher in the dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, edoxaban 60 mg once daily, and rivaroxaban groups compared with the warfarin group. However, the apix- aban group did not signi ﬁcantly increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with the warfarin group. 6.3.1. Antithrombotic Therapy Recommendations for Antithrombotic Therapy Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1A 1. For patients with AF and an estimated annual thromboembolic risk of‡2% per year (eg, CHA2DS2-VASc score of ‡2i nm e na n d‡3 in women), anticoagulation is recommended to prevent stroke and systemic thromboembolism. 1-7 1A 2. In patients with AF who do not have a history of moderate to severe rheumatic mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, and who are candidates for anticoagulation, DOACs are recommended over warfarin to reduce the risk of mortality, stroke, systemic embolism, and ICH. 1-7 2a A 3. For patients with AF and an estimated annual thromboembolic risk of‡1% but <2 %p e ry e a r( e q u i v a l e n t to CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 in men and 2 in women), anticoagulation is reasonable to prevent stroke and systemic thromboembolism. 1,3 3: Harm B-R 4. In patients with AF who are candidates for anticoagulation and without an indication for antiplatelet therapy, aspirin either alone or in combination with clopidogrel as an alternative to anticoagulation is not recommended to reduce stroke risk.8,9 3: No Beneﬁt B-NR 5. In patients with AF without risk factors for stroke,aspirin monotherapy for prevention of thromboembolic events is of no beneﬁt.10,11 Synopsis A high risk for stroke or systemic embolism is about 2% per year, and all the DOAC t rials (Re-LY [Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy]; ROCKET AF [Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Pre- vention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrilla- tion]; ARISTOTLE; and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 [Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation – Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48]) Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 146 included patients with this level of risk. 1-4 Patients at intermediate risk (1%-2%/y) can also bene ﬁtf r o ma n t i - coagulation, and the RE-LY 1 and ARISTOTLE 3 trials included this population. Stroke risk scores applied to cohorts give different stroke rates, and therefore any s c o r es h o u l db ev i e w e da so n l ya ne s t i m a t eo ft r u er i s k ;i n addition some scores used stroke, while others used thromboembolic events. Nonetheless, it is practical to use a validated risk score, such as CHA 2DS2-VASc, ATRIA, or GARFIELD-AF. Future research may yield improved risk scores that reﬁne how to incorporate risk modiﬁers, such as female sex 12 and other parameters such as AF burden. Anticoagulation has also been shown to be superior to antiplatelet therapy to reduce stroke risk. 8,9 Recommen- dations for antithrombotic selection in valvular heart disease (VHD) are provided inSection 6.8.5 (“AF in VHD”) and for AFL inSection 6.8.6 (Figure 10). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Randomized trials published in the 1990s established the superiority of anticoagulation, at that time limited to warfarin, to reduce stroke. 11 Since that time, man- agement has advanced considerably, and the random- ized trials that compared DOACs with warfarin 1-4 are more relevant to current antithrombotic management. In these trials 1-4 and metanalyses, 5-7 DOACs were favored for lower risk of stroke, systemic embolism, and ICH. 1-7 These trials reported the CHADS 2 score. The recently studied ATRIA and Swedish cohorts 13,14 re- ported lower stroke rates, by CHADS2 score, compared with that previously reported. 15 AC H A D S2 score of 1 gave a stroke rate of 1.20 in ATRIA14 and 2.4 in a Swedish cohort. 13 AC H A D S2 score of 2 gave a stroke rate of 2.59 in ATRIA 14 and 3.5 in the Swedish cohort.13 Therefore, the stroke risk of patients in the rivaroxaban 2 and edox- aban4 trials was likely >2% given a required minimum CHADS 2 score of 2, and lower in the apixaban 3 and dabigatran 1 trials that included scores of 0 and 1. A Markov state transition decision model 16 concluded that anticoagulation was preferred for a stroke rate of 1.7%. Therefore, a stroke and systemic embolism risk threshold of 2% is likely to yield a beneﬁtt h a tf a re x - ceeds risk. In some conditions, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the risk of stroke is high enough in- dependent of risk score to indicate anticoagulation. 17 2. In the randomized DOAC trials, all DOACs achieved noninferiority 1-4 and in 2 trials (for dabigatran, RE-LY, and for apixaban, ARISTOTLE) were superior to warfarin. With warfarin, regular assessment of the INR is necessary to maintain a therapeutic value. In the RCTs, the mean time in therapeutic range was only 55% in ROCKET AF 2 and highest at 66% in ARISTOTLE.3 In a meta-analysis, 6 DOACs, compared with warfarin, had a relative risk of stroke of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.91; P<0.0001), a relative risk of mortality of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85-0.95; P¼0.0003), relative risk of ICH of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.39-0.59; P<0.0001), and increased relative risk of bleeding of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.01-1.55;P¼0.043). Although patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical valve were excluded from DOAC trials (and subsequently shown they may have worse outcomes with DOACS), other forms of VHD were allowed, such as aortic stenosis or regurgit ation or mitral regurgita- tion. Bioprosthetic valves and valve repair were allowed in the edoxaban (ENGAGE AF) and apixaban (ARISTOTLE) trials, and valve repair in the rivaroxaban (ROCKET AF) trial. A systematic review 18 of patients with VHD (other than mitral stenosis or mechanical valve) concluded that DOACs were safe. 3. As the DOAC trials 1-4 demonstrated improved safety compared with warfarin, the threshold of using a DOAC might be different than for warfarin. 16 AM a r k o vd e c i - sion model found the tipping point for warfarin to be at 1.7%/year stroke risk. 16 Considering the improved ICH and mortality risk of DOACs compared with warfarin in meta-analyses of the DOAC trials,5-7 it is appropriate to designate a lower stroke risk threshold if a DOAC is utilized. The dabigatran 1 and apixaban3 trials included lower risk patients and about one-third of patients had aC H A D S 2 score of 0 or 1. This likely corresponds to an estimated annual stroke risk of about 1%, considering more recent cohorts. 13,14 This is further supported by meta-analyses that showed a consistent bene ﬁto f DOACs across a broad range of vulnerable patients, including as classiﬁed by CHADS2 scores. 6,7 4. A meta-analysis of AF trials from the 1990s and early 2000s found that while antiplatelet therapy (APT), most commonly aspirin, reduced stroke and systemic embolism compared with placebo, APT was inferior to warfarin in patients with AF. 11 Aspirin was studied compared to apixaban in the AVERROES trial (Apix- aban Versus ASA to Prevent Stroke In AF Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment) 9 for patients unsuitable for VKAs; this trial was stopped early due to the beneﬁt of apixaban over aspirin to prevent stroke or systemic embolism, while major bleeding was similar between the 2 arms. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin was compared to VKAs in ACTIVEW (Atrial ﬁbrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for prevention of Vascular Events), 8 and this trial was stopped prematurely due to the superiority of anticoagulation with VKAs to pre- vent stroke, non –central nervous system systemic embolus, MI, or vascular death. Unless there is an indication for antiplatelet therapy, such as coronary artery disease (CAD) or vascular disease, patients with AF should not be prescribed antiplatelet therapy to reduce stroke risk.

Aspirin therapy was compared with no treatment in patients with low stroke risk in a multicenter RCT in Japan, the Japan Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Trial. 10 This trial was stopped early when an interim analysis showed that aspirin gave a marginally higher risk of major bleeding and was unlikely to prevent primary or secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint was non- cardiovascular death, ICH, major bleeding, and pe- ripheral embolization. A meta-analysis of 7 trials that studied aspirin versus placebo found that aspirin reduced stroke by 19%, which did not reach statistical signi ﬁcance with a CI that included 0 ( –1% to 35%). Four of these were primary prevention trials and showed an absolute risk reduction with aspirin of 0.8% per year, with a number needed to treat of 125. 11 Although aspirin has not been studied in patients without any risk factors for stroke, patients without stroke risk may derive no beneﬁtf r o ma s p i r i nt h e r a p y . In fact, 1 study that analyzed stroke mechanisms in the SPAF (Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation) I-III tri- als demonstrated that aspirin did not decrease the rate of cardioembolic stroke and that AF patients at highest risk for stroke are those with the highest rates of car- dioembolic stroke and have the greatest reduction in stroke with anticoagulants. 19 Thus, modest reduction in stroke observed in some trials may have been related to noncardioembolic stroke in patients with additional risk factors.

Considerations in Managing Anticoagulants Synopsis Multiple factors need to be considered to select an optimal OAC in patients with AF. Efﬁcacy, safety, insur- ance coverage, renal/hepatic function, drug interaction screening, medication adherence, and patient preferences are the major factors for consideration. Dosing of DOACs in patients with AF should be selected based on age, renal function, weight, and concomitant medications. The he- patic function also needs to be evaluated for the appro- priateness of DOACs. Characteristics and dosing of OACs are summarized in Table 13 .A l t h o u g hD O A Cd r u gi n - teractions occur in practice less frequently than with warfarin, clinically signi ﬁcant drug interactions through CYP3A4 and/or p-glycoprotein should be carefully evalu- ated. Strong CYP3A4 and/or p-glycoprotein inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and ritonavir may signi ﬁ- cantly increase DOAC plasma levels and the risk of bleeding, while strong CYP3A4 and/or p-glycoprotein in- ducers such as rifampin, phen ytoin, phenobarbital, pri- midone, carbamazepine, or St. John ’sw o r tm a yl o w e r DOAC plasma levels and increase the risks of stroke or systemic embolism. The routine measurement of DOAC plasma concentrations is not indicated in practice due to the lack of well-established therapeutic ranges in the literature. DOAC levels may be indicated when clinicians assess DOAC adherence for potentially noncompliant pa- tients, quantify residual anticoagulation levels before emergency invasive procedures/surgeries, or evaluate the absorption of DOAC after bariatric surgery. Regular moni- toring is recommended to optimize indications, ensure appropriate dosing, and avoid adverse effects. Suggested laboratory monitoring is summarized inFigure 11. If warfarin is selected over DOACs, achievement of higher time in therapeutic range (eg, $70%), and thorough consideration of drug-drug interactions, vitamin K food intake advice, and patient education on adherence to do- sing instructions are important to reduce adverse effects. Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. Rivaroxaban is contraindicated for patients receiving ketoconazole or ritonavir, because ketoconazole or ri- tonavir coadministration signi ﬁcantly increased rivar- oxaban plasma levels by 158% or 153%, respectively. 1 Apixaban also requires dose adjustment to 2.5 mg twice daily for patients receiving apixaban 5 mg twice daily when ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir is started. 13 Apixaban plasma level was signi ﬁcantly increased by 99% when ketoconazole was coadminis- tered in healthy subjects. 2 The concomitant therapy of dronedarone or ketoconazole for patients with creati- nine clearance (CrCl) 30 to 50 mL/min receiving dabi- gatran requires dose adjustment to dabigatran 75 mg twice daily because it produced comparable dabigatran exposure in patients with CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min receiving the concomitant therapy to patients with CrCl 15 to 29 mL/min receiving only dabigatran. 14 Ar e t r o - spective study revealed that the probability of patients with subreference DOAC levels was signiﬁcantly higher in patients receiving antiepileptic drugs compared to those not receiving any CYP3A4 inducers. 4 The claim- based retrospective cohort study showed that CYP- inducing antiepileptic drug use was signiﬁcantly asso- ciated with an 86% increase in thromboembolic and ischemic adverse events in patients receiving DOACs. 6 A prospective multicenter c ohort study corroborated that the patients receiving concomitant therapy of DOACs and antiepileptic drugs developed a higher rate of stroke/TIA/systemic embolism (5.7% patient-year). 7 Recommendations for Considerations in Managing Anticoagulants Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 C-LD 1. For patients with AF receiving DOACs, optimal management of drug interactions is recommended for those receiving concomit ant therapy with interacting drugs, especially CYP3A4 and/or p-glycoprotein inhibitors or inducers (Table 13).1-7 1 B-R 2. For patients with AF receiving warfarin,* a target INR between 2 and 3 is rec o m m e n d e d ,a sw e l la so p t i m a l management of drug-drug interactions, consistency i n vitamin K dietary intake, and routine INR moni- toring to improve time in therapeutic range and tominimize risks of preventable thromboembolism or major bleeding. 8-10 3: Harm B-NR 3.

Warfarin remains the preferred agent in patients with AF receiving CYP3A4/p-glycoprotein –inducing agents, or moderate-severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve. Also, warfarin may be selected over DOACs in patients with AF due to higher cost or intolerances of DOACs. The optimal INR control, with a therapeutic INR goal of 2 to 3, needs to be achieved through the appropriate drug-drug interaction management, vitamin K dietary education, and routine INR moni- toring. A systematic review of 47 studies found that time in therapeutic INR range showed negative corre- lation with risks of thromboembolism (R, –0.59; P¼0.01) and major bleeding (R, –0.59; P¼0.002). 8 An RCT revealed that a weekly vitamin K dietary modiﬁ- cation signi ﬁcantly achieved a therapeutic INR more frequently than a conventional group (74 versus 58%; P¼0.04) at 90 days after randomization. 9 Am e t a - analysis of 11 RCTs and 61 observational studies for warfarin drug interactions found that the concomitant use of APT (odds ratio [OR], 1.74 [95% CI, 1.56-1.94]), nonsteroidal anti-in ﬂammatory drugs (OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.29-2.59]), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (OR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.42-1.85]), or antimicrobial agents (OR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.45-1.83]) was signiﬁcantly associ- ated with higher risks of clinically relevant bleeding. 10 3. A signiﬁcant number of patients with nonvalvular AF are receiving DOAC off-label doses not compliant with labeling. 15-18 A meta-analysis of cohort studies showed that inappropriately lower DOAC doses are signiﬁcantly associated with higher stroke or systemic embolism risks compared with the standard labeled doses (OR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.02-1.43]; P¼0.03), but no signi ﬁcant differences in bleeding risks were observed (OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.92-1.15]; P¼0.62). 11 Of note, 9 of 16 included studies were performed in Asia, while 4 studies in the United States, 2 studies in Europe, and 1 worldwide study were included. Another meta-analysis of obser- vational studies found that inappropriately higher DOAC doses were signiﬁcantly associated with higher risks of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26 [95% CI, 1.11-1.43]; P¼0.003) or major bleeding (HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.04-1.62]; P¼0.025) compared with the standard doses. 12 In this study, underdosing was also associated with a higher risk of net clinical outcome (HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.04-1.40]; P¼0.04) and all-cause death (HR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.04- 1.48]; P¼0.02). Off-label dosing should be avoided to optimize the efﬁcacy and safety of DOACs. 6.4. Silent AF and Stroke of Undetermined Cause Recommendation for Silent AF and Stroke of Undetermined Cause Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 2a B-R 1. In patients with stroke or TIA of undetermined cause, initial cardiac monitoring and, if needed, extended monitoring with an implantable loop recorder are reasonable to improve detection of AF.1 Synopsis Approximately 25% to 30% of ischemic strokes remain cryptogenic after standa rd stroke evaluation. 2,3 Al a r g e proportion of these events are presumed to be related to occult AF, particularly those of embolic appearance. 4,5 APT is the recommended treatment of choice for patients with cryptogenic stroke, including embolic stroke of un- determined source. 6,7 For patients with AF in general, however, anticoagulation has been shown to be superior to APT for stroke risk reduction.8 Thus, detection of occult AF after stroke may have signiﬁcant therapeutic implica- tions. Randomized trials have shown longer durations of cardiac monitoring result in higher rates of AF detection after stroke. 1,9,10 However, data are limited regarding the effects of extended monitoring on risk reduction of recurrent stroke or poststro ke mortality. For recommen- dations on anticoagulation and risk factors, refer to Section 6.4.1 (“Oral Anticoagulants ”). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Growing evidence supports the use of extended cardiac monitoring for the identiﬁcation of occult AF in patients with cryptogenic stroke. 11,12 In the EMBRACE (30 Day Event Monitoring Belt for Recording Atrial Fibrillation After a Cerebral Ischemic Event) trial, which random- ized 572 patients $55 years of age with recent crypto- genic stroke or TIA to either 30-day external loop recorder or conventional 24-hour Holter monitoring, extended monitoring was associated with higher rates of AF detection at 90 days. 1 The CRYSTAL-AF (Cryptogenic Stroke and Underlying AF) trial randomized 441 patients$40 years of age with recent cryptogenic stroke or TIA to cardiac monitoring with either insertable loop recorder or conventional follow-up ECGs. Implantable recorder was superior in detecting AF at 6 months (8.9% versus 1.4%), 12 months (12.4% versus Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 152 2.0%), and 3 years (30% versus 3%).9 In FIND-AF (Future Innovations in Novel Detection of Atrial Fibrillation), which compared repeated sets of 10-day Holter monitoring (at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month timepoints) to con- ventional 24-Holter in patients $60 years of age with recent stroke, higher rates of detection were associated with repeated monitoring (14% versus 5%; absolute dif- ference, 9.0% [95% CI, 3.4-14.5];P¼0.002). 10 Finally, the PER DIEM (Post-Embolic Rhythm Detection with Implantable vs External Monitoring) RCT also showed a signiﬁcantly greater proportion of patients with AF detected at 1 year with prolonged monitoring.13 Additional studies are needed, however, to determine whether extended cardiac monitoring improves long-term post- stroke outcomes. 6.4.1.

Patients with a device-detected AHRE lasting <5 minutes and without another indication for oral anti- coagulation should not receive oral anticoagulation. 4,5 Synopsis AHREs detected by a cardiova scular implantable elec- tronic device are associated with a stroke risk lower than that of clinical AF 6 that varies accord ing to the episode duration 1 and CHA2DS2-VASc score. 2 Clinician con ﬁrma- tion of the duration and nature of the longest atrial high- rate episode is recommended. 1 Episodes lasting $24 hours are associated with a signi ﬁcant risk of stroke or systemic embolism 1,7 that may be reduced with oral anti- coagulation. 3 By contrast, short ep isodes, commonly deﬁned as <5 minutes, are not associated with clinical events. 4,5 Patients with episodes of intermediate duration and with an elevated stroke risk may bene ﬁt from oral anticoagulation. 2 There is an interaction between AHRE duration and CHA2DS2-VASc score, 2 suggesting both may be used to guide oral anticoagulation candidacy (Figure 12 ). Of note, the threshold for anticoagulation is higher as in device-detected AF the risk of stroke may be l o w e rt h a ni nc l i n i c a lA F . Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. AHREs lasting $24 hours are associated with an elevated risk of stroke th at varies according to CHA 2DS2-VASc score. AHRE burden is most commonly deﬁned according to the duration of the longest- detected episode, though cumulative duration has also been examined. In a secondary analysis of the ASSERT (Atrial Fibrillation Reduction Atrial Pacing Trial), adjudicated AHREs >24 hours was associated with an increased risk of subsequent stroke or systemic embolism (adjusted HR, 3.24 [95% CI, 1.51-6.95]; P¼0.003). 1 Similar ﬁndings are seen in observational studies in which most AHREs were not adjudicated, 7 though clinician con ﬁrmation is preferred. In an observational study linking administrative claims data 2 to a device database in which continuous rhythm monitoring data were available but not adjudicated, the risk of stroke among patents with subclinical AF >23.5 hours and a sex-modiﬁed CHA2DS2-VASc score $2n o t taking anticoagulation exceeded 1% per year, a threshold that may be appropriate for use of non-VKAs, with a still higher stroke risk with increasing CHA 2DS2- VASc score $3.8 In a retrospective cohort study of pa- tients with subclinical AF >24 hours with an average CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4.2/C6 1.4, treatment of subclini- cal AF >24 hours with OAC was associated with a reduced stroke risk (HR, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.10-0.81]; P¼0.02). 2,3 2. Although the risk of stroke among patients with an AHRE of intermediate duration is lower than that among patients with an AHRE $24 hours, the precise stroke risk is uncertain and may vary according to the JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 153 CHA2DS2-VASc score. In ASSERT, AHREs lasting >6 minutes to 24 hours were not associated with stroke or systemic embolism compared with patients without AHREs. 1 The CHA2DS2-VASc score of this subpopulation was 2.2/C6 1.0 (mean/C6 SD). In the aforementioned study linking administrative claims data to a device database in which continuous rhythm monitoring data were available, the risk of stroke and systemic embolism off anticoagulation exceeded 1% among patients with a sex-modi ﬁed CHA 2DS2-VASc score of 3 to 4 and exceeded 2% among patients with a sex-modi ﬁed CHA2DS2-VASc score $5.2 3. Brief episodes of subclinical AF are at low risk of clin- ical events. In RATE (Registry of Atrial Tachycardia and Atrial Fibrillation), patients with clinical events such as hospitalization, death, or stroke were more likely than those without to have AHREs with either onset or offset of an adjudicated, single ECG (31.9% versus 22.1% among patients with pacemakers and 28.7% and 20.2% among patients with implantable cardioverter- FIGURE 12 Consideration of Oral Anticoagulation for Device-Det ected AHREs According to Patient Stroke Risk by CHA2DS2-VASc Score and Episode Duration A potential approach to patients with SCAF could consider both patient risk (as gauged by the CHA2DS2-VASc score) and SCAF burden/duration.

Nonpharmacological Stroke Prevention Although oral anticoagulation is the standard of care to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with AF, it is contraindicated in some patients due to an excess risk of major bleeding. Surgical and percutaneous techniques to occlude the LAA have been developed to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. These techniques have the potential to obviate the need for or supplement long-term oral anti- coagulation in select patients. Surgical LAAO is a partic- ularly important consideration in patients with AF who undergo cardiac surgery. 6.5.1. Percutaneous Approaches to Occlude the LAA Recommendations for Percutaneous Approaches to Occlude the LAA Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 2a B-NR 1. In patients with AF, a moderate to high risk of stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score ‡2), and a contraindication (Table 14) to long-term oral anticoagulation due to a nonreversible cause, percutaneous LAAO (pLAAO) is reasonable. 1-4 2b B-R 2. In patients with AF and a moderate to high risk of stroke and a high risk of major bleeding on oral anticoagulation, pLAAO may be a reasonable alternati ve to oral anticoagulation based on patient pref- erence, with careful consideration of procedural r isk and with the understanding that the evidence for oral anticoagulation is more extensive. 1-3,5,6 Synopsis A large body of evidence supports the use of OACs to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with AF; however, OACs may be contraindicated in some patients (Table 14). pLAAO devices are designed to prevent embo- lization of LAA thrombi and potentially obviate the need for OAC for stroke risk reduction.

This low ischemic stroke was demonstrated despite most of the patients (73%) not using oral anti- coagulation periprocedurally. 6 The PINNACLE FLX (Protection Against Embolism for Nonvalvular AF Pa- tients: Investigational Device Evaluation of the Watchman FLX LAA Closure Technology) prospective registry of the next-generation Watchman FLX device showed a high rate of procedural success (98.8%) and a low rate (0.5%) of the primary safety endpoint (death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, procedure-related events requiring open cardiac surgery or major endo- vascular intervention). 7 Registry data have shown sub- stantial variation in postp rocedure antithrombotic regimens in real-world practice compared with pro- tocols in the pivotal RCTs; the effect this has on long- term outcomes has not been clearly established. 8 JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 155 ASAP-TOO (Assessment of the Watchman Device in Patients Unsuitable for Oral Anticoagulation) is an ongoing RCT evaluating the safety and ef ﬁcacy of LAAO in patients with AF who are deemed ineligible for oral anticoagulation. 9 2.

The PREVAIL (Watchman LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy) study was a follow-up RCT that compared the Watchman device with warfarin in a similar patient population. 2 pLAAO did not achieve noninferiority for the ﬁrst primary composite ef ﬁcacy endpoint (stroke, systemic embo- lism, and cardiovascular/unexplained death) but was limited in statistical power because of unexpectedly low event rates. pLAAO was statistically noninferior to warfarin for nonprocedure-related strokes. Higher implant success and lower procedure-related safety event rates were observed in PREVAIL than PROTECT AF. A 5-year patient-level meta-analysis of these tri- als demonstrated similar ef ﬁcacy of pLAAO for stroke prevention and reduced rates of major bleeding compared with warfarin. 3 PRAGUE-17 (Left Atrial Appendage Closure vs Novel Anticoagulation Agents in Atrial Fibrillation) was an RCT that compared pLAAO with DOACs in patients with nonvalvular AF. 4 pLAAO was noninferior to DOACs for the combined safety and ef ﬁcacy composite endpoint (stroke, TIA, systemic embolism, cardiovascular death, major or nonmajor clinically releva nt bleeding, or procedure-/ device-related complications). 6.5.2.

A 2019 meta-analysis before the publication of LAAOS III reviewed 22 studies, including 280,585 patients of whom 36,686 underwent S-LAAO during cardiac surgery. S-L AAO showed an association with a 29% lower risk of stroke or thromboembolism. The all-cause mortality rate at 2 years was lower in patients who underwent S-LAAO. No bene ﬁtw a sf o u n di nt h e subgroup of studies that included patients without pre- operative AF. 9 These favorable ﬁndings were validated by the 4770-subject LAAOS III, which con ﬁrmed S-LAAO in Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 156 addition to OAC provides a 33% reduction in risk of stroke and systemic embolism. 1 LAAOS III enrolled only patients with preexisting AF; evidence of the effectiven ess of S-LAAO in patients without AF is inconsistent and suggests the bene ﬁto f adjunctive S-LAAO is unclear in patients without preop- erative AF. 7,9 The results of ongoing RCTs in this popu- lation are awaited. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. LAAOS III was performed with 4770 patients with AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score $2 undergoing cardiac sur- gery randomized to S-LAAO or no S-LAAO. Intra- operative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was recommended to assess successful closure using an endorsed technique. Oral anticoagulation was continued postoperatively. After a mean follow-up of 3.8 years, the primary endpoint of stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 4.8% of the S-LAAO group and 7.0% of the no S-LAAO group (HR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.53- 0.85]; P¼0.001). Mortality rate, cross-clamp and bypass time, chest tube output, and bleeding were not different between groups. More than 75% of subjects in both groups received OAC. These data indicate S-LAAO provides additional bene ﬁt to oral anticoagulation without increasing risk of adverse events. These ﬁndings cannot be extrapolated to patients without AF or patients who are not candidates for OAC. Most subjects underwent CABG or valve surgery, and the mean CHA 2DS2-VASc score was 4.2. Surgical AF ablation was performed in one-third of both groups. Patients un- dergoing mechanical valve surgery, transplant, off-pump bypass, left ventricular assistive device surgery, and congenital heart disease (CHD) cases were excluded. A subsequent meta-analysis of 5 RCTs and 22 observational studies including 540,111 patients showed a signiﬁcant decrease in stroke and thromboembolism with S-LAAO. 11 The postoperative mortality rate did not differ but, in follow-up, was reduced in the S-LAAO group after 2 years. No difference in major bleeding, all-cause rehospi- talizations, or cross-clamp time was observed. 11 2. Substantial heterogeneity in S-LAAO methods exists in the literature, and not all techniques effectively exclude the LAA. 4 An increased risk of stroke and thromboembolism is associated with incomplete S- LAAO5,12; however, many studies do not report assessment of occlusion success. 9 This inconsistency has likely contributed to the variability in outcome.7,9 LAAOS III permitted 4 techniques: amputation and closure (which was promoted as the preferred tech- nique), used in 56%; stapler closure, used in 11%; double-layer linear closure (if conﬁrmed by TEE), used in 14%; or an approved LAAO device, used in 15%. Other techniques were approved on a case-by-case basis (4%). Intraoperative TEE was recommended to assess successful closure, de ﬁned as absence of ﬂow across the suture line and a stump of <1c m .I ft h e initial closure was unsuccessful, additional suturing was performed for repair. Contemporary data show closure success of >95% using a surgical clip device. 13 In the LAAOS series, the mean cross-clamp and bypass times were similar, and perioperative bleeding was not increased in the S-LAAO group. 1,4 These data support the importance of complete S-LAAO in achieving bene ﬁcial outcomes. 3. In LAAOS III, S-LAAO reduced stroke and thrombo- embolism by 33% in addition to OAC. LAAOS III was not designed to resolve whether oral anticoagulation can be safely stopped after S-LAAO; at hospital discharge, >80% of subjects in both groups were receiving OAC, with >75% on OAC at the 3-year visit. 1 A systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on the effects of anticoagulation found no statistically signi ﬁcant difference in stro ke rates of S-LAAO/no S- LAAO subjects on OAC versus off OAC, with high heterogeneity noted for both ischemic events and mortality, 14 and ﬁndings are subject to confounding by indication and the potentially bene ﬁcial effects of surgical AF ablation. The LAACS (Left Atrial Appendage Closure with Surgery) study of 187 sub- jects undergoing CABG, valve surgery, or both who were randomized to S-LAAO versus no S-LAAO showed a reduction in the risk of stroke in the S- LAAO group, independent of anticoagulation status. 15 These results must be inte rpreted with caution, however, because the study was not powered to demonstrate a reduction in stroke, and substantial crossover occurred.

Failure to achieve effective hemostasis is associated with a >3 times higher risk of death. 18 Idar- ucizumab for dabigatran-induced major bleeding and andexanet alfa for apixaban or rivaroxaban associated major bleeding are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved. Four-factor PCC for DOAC-induced major bleeding was compared with andexanet alfa in retro- spective cohort studies, but the comparison has never been investigated in clinical trials. 7 For VKA, if life- threatening bleeding cannot be managed with support- ive measures, the rapid reversal treatment with 4-factor PCC is preferred over fresh frozen plasma. 8-10 Table 15 summarizes reversal agents for OACs. Table 16 describes bleeding events attributable to DOACs in pivotal clinical trials. Recommendation-Supportive Text 1. The RE-VERSE AD (Reversal of Dabigatran Anticoagulant Effect With Idarucizumab) study was a multicenter, pro- spective cohort study evaluating the use of idarucizumab in patients receiving dabigatran for the management of uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding or in patients requiring urgent surgery or invasive procedure. 1 In pa- tients with uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding, idarucizumab reversed the dabigatran anticoagulation effect in 100% of patients, and 67.7% had bleeding cessation. Thrombosis events after the reversal agent use was 4.7% within 30 days. However, this study did not have a control group. The post hoc analysis of the RE- VERSE AD study in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding found that 97.5% of patients achieved complete reversal of dabigatran, and bleeding cessation occurred in 76.2% of patients. 2 Another post hoc analysis of the same study showed that idarucizumab was effective at reversing dabigatran’s anticoagulation effect, regardless of baseline renal function.3 2.

The effectiveness of activated PCC was assessed based on the assessment guide rating from good, moderate, and poor. Nine patients (64%) were rated as good, 5 patients (36%) as moderate, and none as poor. No thromboembolic events were found. A randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 12 healthy sub- jects evaluated the reversal effect of 4-factor PCC on rivaroxaban or dabigatran ’se f f e c t . 5 It showed 4-factor PCC completely reversed rivaroxaban ’s effect based the prothrombin time, but it did not reverse dabiga- tran’s effect based on the coagulation tests (aPTT, ecarin clotting time, and th rombin time). Four-factor PCC may not be appropriate for dabigatran-associated major bleeding management until further investiga- tion is performed in prospective studies. 3.

For 4-factor PCC, a meta-analysis of 22 observational studies compared andexanet alfa (n¼438) with PCC (n ¼1278) in patients with acute bleeding associated with oral factor Xa inhibitors. 7 It showed that mean hemostatic effectiveness for andexanet alfa was 82% at 12 hours and 71% at 24 hours versus 88% at 12 hours and 76% at 24 hours for PCC. Mean 30-day venous thromboembolism rate was 5.0% in the andexanet alfa group versus 1.9% in the PCC group. However, the meta-analysis had more signi ﬁ- cant methodological issues than the ANNEXA 4 trial. Thus, the level of evidence for the 4-factor PCC use was downgraded. 4. A meta-analysis of 13 studies (5 randomized trials and 8 observational studies) compared 4-factor PCC with fresh frozen plasma for warfarin-associated bleeding or urgent surgery/procedure. 8 Four-factor PCC use was signi ﬁcantly associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality (25.1% versus 28.8%; OR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.37-0.84]), higher probability to achieve INR correc- tion (60.6% versus 12.8%; OR, 10.8 [95% CI, 6.12- 19.07]), shortened time to INR correction (–6.5 h [95% CI, –9.75 h to –3.24 h]), and lower risk of volume overload (2.1% versus 8.8%; OR, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.13- 0.58]) compared with fresh frozen plasma. No signiﬁ- cant difference in thromboembolic events (4.2% versus 4.8%; OR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.44-1.89];P¼0.81) was found. 5. A meta-analysis of 10 cohort studies compared anti- coagulation resumption (n ¼2,080) versus discontinua- tion (n¼2,296) after gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving OACs for AF, venous thromboembolism, or prosthetic valve. 11 Restarting anticoagulation was signiﬁcantly associated with higher risks of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding (10.1% versus 5.3%) but also with lower risks of thromboembolic events (6.3% versus 10.6% ) and a reduction in all-cause mortality (21.3% versus 31%). Another meta-analysis of 7 observational studies in patients with AF found no signiﬁcant differ- ence in stroke rates between resumption and discon- tinuation groups (9.1% versus 8.3%; OR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.37-1.51]). 12 Resumption of anticoagulation therapy was associated with signi ﬁcant reduction in any thrombo- embolic events (8.0% versus 12.2%; OR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.43-0.68]) and all-cause mortality (10.8% absolute risk reduction; OR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.24-0.60]), at the expense of recurrent major bleeding (10.2% versus 5.0%). One study found the optimal timing of resuming a VKA after upper gastrointestinal bleeding was between 3 and 6 weeks, while other studies revealed that resuming a VKA 1 week after gastrointestinal bleeding is the optimal timing. 19-21 There is a paucity of data evaluating the timing of DOACs after gastrointestinal bleeding. 6.6.1. Management of Patients With AF and ICH Recommendations for Management of Patients With AF and ICH Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 2a C-LD 1. In patients with AF and conditions associated with very high risk of thromboembolic events (>5%/year), such as rheumatic heart disease or a mechanical heart valve, early (1-2 weeks) resumption of anti- coagulation after ICH is reasonable to reduce the risk of thromboembolic events.1 2b C-LD 2. In patients with AF and ICH, delayed (4-8 weeks) resumption of anticoagulation may be considered to balance the risks of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications after careful risk beneﬁta s s e s s - ment. 2-5 2b B-NR 3. In patients with AF and conditionsassociated with high risk of recurrent ICH (eg, cerebral amyloid angiopathy) anticoagulation-sparing strategie s (eg, LAAO) may be considered to reduce the risk of recurrent hemorrhage. 6,7 Synopsis ICH is a term that refers to bleeding within any of the compartments of the cranial vault, including intra- parenchymal (or intracerebral), subarachnoid, subdural, and epidural hemorrhage. In clinical practice, the different forms of ICH are often classiﬁed by mechanism and most broadly as traumatic and nontraumatic or spontaneous ICHs ( Figure 14 ). In patients with AF and conditions associated with high-risk for thromboembolic complications (eg, mechanical valve, rheumatic valvular disease), anticoagulation is often resumed early after ICH, regardless of mechanism. For other patients with AF, de- cisions regarding if (and when) to resume anticoagulation after ICH requires more careful risk-beneﬁt assessment of patient-speci ﬁc clinical factors. Patients with traumatic etiologies generally have lower long-term risk of recurrent hemorrhage, and anticoagulation is generally considered safe to resume. Nontraumatic/spontaneous etiologies (eg, JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 161 hypertensive parenchyma l hemorrhage, hemorrhagic transformation after ischemic stroke, cerebral amyloid angiopathy-associated hem orrhage, chronic subdural hemorrhage) are generally a ssociated with higher risk of recurrence. Clinical decision-making regarding the appropriateness of resumption in these patients is based largely on individual risk-bene ﬁt calculations given the lack of randomized data assessing safety and long-term outcomes. For patients with ICH deemed at high risk of recurrence, LAA closure may b e a viable alternative to anticoagulation, although data on efﬁcacy and safety are lacking in the ICH population. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Rheumatic valvular dis ease is associated with a >5% per year risk of embolic events. 8 In patients with me- chanical heart valves, the rate can range from 4% to 23% per year depending on the type and position of the prosthetic. 9-11 These rates are even higher in patients with concurrent AF but are signiﬁcantly reduced with the use of VKAs. Data are limited that explore the safety and timing of anticoagulation resumption in patients with ICH and high-risk valvular disease. In 1 observational analysis of 137 patients with ICH and mechanical heart valves, resuming anticoagulation within 2 weeks from index ICH was associated with increased hemorrhagic complications (HR, 7.06 [95% CI, 2.33-21.37]). 1 However, in balancing the risk of hemorrhagic with thrombotic complications, the optimal window of resumption was found to be be- tween 1 and 2 weeks post-ICH after weighing individual patient factors (Table 17). 2. Anticoagulation is associated with up to 25% of ICHs and is associated with worse functional outcomes and higher mortality. 12-15 After ICH, anticoagulation is generally held in the acute setting. Decisions regarding the appropriateness and timing of resumption are complex given the limited amount of randomized data addressing risks and bene ﬁts in this population. Pre- vious observational reports evaluating risk of recurrent ICH, thromboembolism, and mortality in patients with nonvalvular AF have suggested possible reduction in thromboembolic risk and mortality with resumption of anticoagulation but are limited by discordant patient populations and study designs, predominant use of VKAs, and potential selection biases. 16-22 In a meta- analysis of 2,452 patients with AF and ICH, resump- tion of OACs was associated with lower risk of ischemic stroke (RR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.29-0.72]) and no difference in risk of recurrent ICH compared with patients in whom anticoagulation was not resumed 2 (Table 17 ). However, data are limited on the optimal timing for resumption. In an analysis of 2,619 ICH survivors with AF, a composite net beneﬁt minimizing risk of bleeding and thromboembolic comp lications occurred when FIGURE 14 Forms of ICH, Classiﬁed by Mechanism ICH indicates intracranial hemorrhage.

Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 162 anticoagulation was resumed at 7 to 8 weeks after ICH.3 In a retrospective study that included 1,752 patients with OAC-related ICH across 3 Danish registries, anti- coagulation resumed a median of 34 days was associ- ated with an adjusted HR of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, and all-cause mortality of 0.55 (95% CI, 0.39-0.78) compared with no anticoagulation. 4 In another meta-analysis of 8 observational studies, resuming OAC was associated with reduced risk of ischemic stroke without increased risk of recurrent ICH at a median time to resumption of 10 to 39 days 5 (Table 17). Of note, DOACs have been associated with lower rates of major bleeding complications compared with VKAs.23 3. Anticoagulation is used for stroke risk reduction in patients with AF at risk of thromboembolism. For some patients, however, risk of recurrent ICH may be pro- hibitively high with anticoagulation. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is the most common cause of lobar hem- o r r h a g ei no l d e ra d u l t sa n di sa s s o c i a t e dw i t ha n n u a l ICH recurrence risk that ranges from 5% in patients with isolated microhemorrhages to 26.9% in patients with associated cortical superﬁcial siderosis. 24 Thus, in patients with AF and cerebral amyloid angiopathy- related ICH, alternative strategies for secondary stroke prevention are often pursued. The LAA is considered the most common site for thrombus for- mation in patients with AF. 25,26 Two RCTs— PROTECT AF study and PREVAIL study— compared rates of stroke and mortality after LAA closure versus VKA in patients with AF. 6,7 In a meta-analysis examining 5-year out- comes in the 2 RCTs, LAA closure was associated with signi ﬁcant reductions in hemorrhagic stroke, disabling and fatal stroke, and all-cause mortality, with compa- rable rates of stroke and systemic embolism compared with warfarin. 27 Of note, both studies excluded pa- tients who were not candidates for anticoagulation. Additionally, newer treatment options such as epicar- dial LAA clipping are emerging for stroke prevention without need for postprocedure APT. 28,29 6.7.

In patients with AF on DOAC and scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure or surgery that cannot be performed safely on uninterrupted anticoagulation, the timing of interruption of DOAC should be guided by the speciﬁc agent, renal function, and the bleeding risk of the procedure (Table 18).4,11,12 2a B-NR 5. In patients with AF on DOAC that has been interrupted for an invasive procedure or surgery, in general, resumption of anticoagulation the day after low bleeding risk surgery and between the evening of the second day and the evening of the third day after high bleeding risk surgery is reasonable, as long as hemostasis has been achieved and further bleeding is not anticipated.4 3: Harm B-R 6. In patients with AF on warfarin anticoagulation, who are undergoing surgeries or procedures for which they are holding warfarin, except in patients with mechanical valve or recent stroke or TIA, bridging anticoagulation with low-molecular-wei ght heparin should not be administered.1,3,13-15 *B-R LOE applies to the data on warfarin.†B-NR LOE applies to the data on DOAC. Synopsis Periprocedural anticoagulation management is driven by 2 competing aims: to hold the anticoagulant agent for the shortest possible time to minimize the risk of throm- boembolism and to ensure coagulation parameters are as close to normal as possible at the time of the procedure to JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 163 facilitate hemostasis and avoid intra- and postoperative bleeding. Considerations include the bleeding risk of the procedure, consequences of bleeding should it occur, patient-speci ﬁc risk factors, and thrombotic risk while off anticoagulation. Invasive procedures and surgeries have been divided into high and low bleeding risks in several different classi ﬁcations. 16 Generally, endoscopic, dental extraction, many ophthalmologic procedures, and percu- taneous vascular access, such as cardiac catheterization, are considered to be of low bleeding risk. Higher bleeding risk surgeries include intra- abdominal, pelvic, orthope- dic, neurosurgical, cardiac, and transvenous lead extrac- tion procedures. Very high bleeding risk procedures include neuraxial anesthesia a n ds p i n a ls u r g e r y .A v a i l a b l e data do not suggest high rates of bleeding from these procedures, although bleeding could cause signi ﬁcant consequences. 17 Patient-speci ﬁc factors include abnormal liver and kidney function, bleeding or clotting disorders, concomitant antiplatelet or nonsteroidal anti- inﬂammatory use, alcohol, and anemia. Recent bleeding or thromboembolism may increase the risk for recurrent events. To put thrombotic risk in perspective, the inci- dence of thromboembolism while anticoagulation was temporarily held has generally been <1%. 3,18 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. To mitigate thromboembol ic risk during interruption of warfarin therapy for a procedure or surgery, “bridging ” anticoagulation can be administered. How- ever, observational studies consistently showed an increased risk of bleeding without a difference in thromboembolic risk with this strategy. 3 The BRIDGE (Bridging Anticoagulation in Patients who Require Temporary Interruption of W arfarin Therapy for an Elective Invasive Procedur e or Surgery) trial included patients with a mean CHADS 2 score of 2.3 (range, 1-6); 61.7% of patients had a CHADS2 score <3.1 In this study, discussed in more depth below, interruption of warfarin without bridging anticoagulation was supe- rior to bridging. 1 In a meta-analysis of 6 observational studies reporting on patients not at high thromboem- bolic risk receiving prophylactic dose or no bridging had an overall thromboembolic event rate of 0.6% (11 of 1,702). 3 A similar RCT has not been done in the DOAC era, given the ease of brief interruption of DOAC therapy; however, observational studies have shown similar results. 2 The PAUSE (Perioperative Anti- coagulation Use for Surgery Evaluation) cohort study, discussed below, enrolling patients with a mean CHADS 2 score of 2.1 (range, 1-6) and CHA 2DS2-VASc score of 3.5 (range, 1-9), found a low incidence of thromboembolic events when DOAC was brieﬂyi n t e r - rupted without bridging. 4 This suggests that in pa- tients at low-to-moderat e thromboembolic risk, interruption of anticoagulation, without bridging, may provide a low risk of bleeding with an acceptable risk of stroke/TIA. Patients with mechanical valves, and recent stroke/TIA, or other high-risk markers, were not included in most studies and may still bene ﬁtf r o m bridging anticoagulation: in these scenarios, manage- ment should be individualized. 2. Evidence has accrued that periprocedural unfractio- nated or low-molecular-weight heparin bridging has been associated with an increased risk of pocket he- matoma after pacemaker or ICD procedures. 19 BRUISE- CONTROL (Bridge or Continue Coumadin for Device S u r g e r yR a n d o m i z e dC o n t r o l l e dT r i a l )r a n d o m i z e d patients with AF (88%) or a mechanical valve with an estimated annual stroke risk of $5%, and undergoing elective device surgery, to continued warfarin versus warfarin interruption with bridging anticoagulation. The incidence of clinically signi ﬁcant pocket hema- toma was >4 times higher in the bridging group. 5 Several other procedures have been performed on un- interrupted anticoagulation. 20 Further study is needed to de ﬁne which procedures, in which patients, can safely be performed with uninterrupted anti- coagulation. Lead extraction procedures are generally considered high bleeding risk and therefore should be treated as such (high bleeding risk procedures in Table 18 ) and warfarin interrupted, with occasional exceptions. 3. Two RCTs and several observational studies have shown little or no difference in the risk of pocket TABLE 18 Timing of Discontinuation of OACs in Patients With AF Scheduled to Undergo an Invasive Pro- cedure or Surgery in Whom Anticoagulation Is to Be Interrupted Anticoagulant Low Bleeding Risk Procedure High Bleeding Risk Procedure Apixaban (CrCl>25 mL/min)* 1d † 2d Dabigatran (CrCl>50 mL/min) 1d 2d Dabigatran (CrCl 30-50 mL/min) 2d 4d Edoxaban (CrCl>15 mL/min) 1d 2d Rivaroxaban (CrCl>30 mL/min) 1d 2d Warfarin 5 d for a target INR <1.5 2-3 d for a target INR <2 5d *For patients on DOAC with creatinine clearance lower than the values in the table, few clinical data exist. Consider holding for an additional 1 to 3 days, especially for high bleeding risk procedures. †The number of days is the number of full days before the day of surgery in which the patient does not take any dose of anticoagulant. The drug is also not taken the day of surgery. For example, in the case of holding a twice daily drug for 1 day, if the drug is taken at 8 pm, and surgery is at 8 am, at the time of surgery, it will be 36 hours since the last dose was taken. AF indicates atrial ﬁbrillation; CrCl, creatinine clearance; DOAC, direct oral anti- coagulation; INR, international normalized ratio; and OAC, oral anticoagulant.

Lead extraction procedures are gener- ally considered high bleeding risk and therefore should be treated as such (high bleeding risk procedures in Table 18 ) and DOAC interrupted, with occasional exceptions. 4. To achieve the goals of reducing or eliminating antico- agulant effect at the time of surgery, while also mini- mizing the time the patient spends without anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolism, the duration of cessation of anticoagulation should take into account both the pharmacokinetics and pharma- codynamics of the agent, the patient’s renal function, and the bleeding risk of the procedure. Direct mea- surement of DOAC levels is unavailable in clinical practice, but levels<3 0n g / m L ,w h i c hc o r r e s p o n dt ot h e expected plasma DOAC concentration reached after 3 half-lives, when most of the drug (87.5% of the Cmax) has been eliminated, is reached in two-thirds of patients 24 to 48 hours after the last drug intake. 11 Similar results were observed for apixaban. 12 Ad r u g “hold” of 48 hours in clinical practice typically means 2 full days without drug intake, in addition to the day of the procedure, leading to a longer interval between last drug intake and procedure start longer than 48 hours, usually an additional 12 hours. Meta-analysis of the reports of periprocedural events from the pivotal trials of each of the 4 available DOACs suggested similar outcomes in patients on DOAC or warfarin, with reduced major bleeding during an uninterrupted strat- egy with DOACs. 21 The PAUSE protocol was studied in patients on apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, and resulted in low rates of majo r bleeding (0.9%-1.85%) and thromboembolism ( <1%). A high rate ( >90%) of minimal anticoagulant level (<50 ng/mL) was achieved. Similar results have been observed with edoxaban in clinical practice. 22 Different protocols have not been directly compared. Table 18 presents recommended DOAC interruption times based on agent, renal func- tion, and the bleeding risk of the procedure. 5. The timing of resumption of interrupted anti- coagulation after surgery is a complex decision that should integrate patient and surgical characteristics.

Postoperative bridging anti- coagulation has not been shown to be generally bene- ﬁcial. 1,13 In the PAUSE study, DOACs were started on the ﬁrst postoperative day for low bleeding risk pro- cedures and between the evening of the second and third postoperative days for high bleeding risk pro- cedures. This resulted in a low risk of major bleeding. 4 Input from the proceduralist should always be incor- porated into decisions. 6. Several studies have compared a strategy of bridging anticoagulation with a comparator of no bridging in patients on anticoagulan ts who were scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure or surgery. The BRIDGE trial randomized 1,884 patients with AF or AFL to bridging anticoagulation before and after the proced- ure with dalteparin versus placebo. 1 Almost 90% of patients were undergoing low bleeding risk proced- ures. No bridging was superior to bridging with respect to major bleeding and was noninferior with respect to thromboembolism, although the observed rate (0.4%) was lower than anticipated (1.0%). PERIOP2 (A Double Blind Randomized Control Trial of Post-Operative Low Molecular Weight Heparin Bridging Therapy Versus Placebo Bridging Therapy for Patients Who Are at High Risk for Arterial Thromboembolism) randomized pa- tients, about two-thirds of whom were undergoing high bleeding risk procedures, and 79% of whom had AF, to postoperative bridging with dalteparin or pla- cebo until the INR was >1.9. All patients received preoperative bridging. Bleeding and thromboembolism outcomes were similar. 13 These studies also excluded patients with recent bleeding or thromboembolism, and those undergoing spinal and neurological surgery, and in these cases, management should be individu- alized and may include bridging anticoagulation. 1,13 A small randomized trial found that dental extractions could be performed on uninterrupted warfarin without bridging. 14 A large multicenter registry also did not ﬁnd a difference in thromboembolism, but an increase in bleeding, in bridged patients. 15 Patients with me- chanical valves should be managed as outlined in the “2020 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of Pa- tients With Valvular Heart Disease.” 23 6.8. Anticoagulation in Speciﬁc Populations 6.8.1. AF Complicating ACS or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) Recommendations for AF Complicating ACS or PCI Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1A 1. In patients with AF and an increased risk for stroke who undergo PCI, DOACs are preferred over VKAs in combination with APT to reduce the risk of clinically relevant bleeding.1-5 1A 2. In most patients with AF who take oral anticoagulation and undergo PCI, early discontinuation of aspirin (1-4 wk) and continuation of dual antithrombotic therapy with OAC and a P2Y12 inhibitor is preferred over triple therapy (OAC, P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin) to reduce the risk of clinically relevant bleeding.1-4,6 Synopsis Encountering a patient with AF at an increased risk for stroke who undergoes PCI for stable CAD or ACS is a common clinical scenario. The addition of APT to OAC after PCI introduces a risk for clinically signi ﬁcant bleeding. RCTs have compared the safety and efﬁcacy of various antithrombotic regimens after PCI is performed in patients with AF. They hav e consistently shown that DOACs, when used in conjunction with APT, are associ- ated with a lower risk of clinically relevant bleeding compared to VKAs. 1-5 They have also shown that dual therapy with an OAC and single APT with a P2Y12 inhibitor signi ﬁcantly lowers the risk of clinically relevant bleeding compared with triple therapy (oral anticoagulation, P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin) witho ut substantially increasing risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. 1-4,6 Meta- analyses of these trials have shown a slightly increased risk of stent thrombosis with dual therapy compared to triple therapy. 5 Thus, the risk of stent thrombosis must be weighed against the risk of bleeding in determining the antithrombotic regimen after PCI. This is particularly true in patients with a relatively high perceived risk of stent thrombosis (complex revascularization, multivessel PCI, previous history of stent thrombosis).

Post-PCI antithrombotic regimens comparing DOACs with VKAs in combination with APT in patients with AF w h od on o th a v eas p e c iﬁc indication for VKAs (eg, mechanical valve) have consistently shown a reduction in clinically relevant bleeding. 1,2,4 A meta-analysis of 3 R C T sc o m p a r i n gD O A C sw i t hV K A sa f t e rP C I ,P I O N E E R AF-PCI (Open-Label, Random ized, Controlled, Multi- center Study Exploring Two Treatment Strategies of Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 166 Rivaroxaban and a Dose-Adjusted Oral Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment Strategy in Subjects with Atrial Fibrillation who Undergo Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) (rivaroxaban), RE-DUAL PCI trial (Ran- domized Evaluation of Dual Antithrombotic Therapy with Dabigatran versus Triple Therapy with Warfarin in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Undergo- ing Percutaneous Coronary Int ervention) (dabigatran), and AUGUSTUS (Open-Label, 2 /C2 2 Factorial, Random- ized, Controlled Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety of Apixaban vs Vitamin K An tagonist and Aspirin vs Aspirin Placebo in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Acute Coronary Syndrome and/or Percutaneous Coro- nary Intervention) (apixab an), showed a 42% relative risk reduction for major bleeding in DOAC-based regi- mens compared with VKA-based regimens (OR, 0.577 [95% CI, 0.477-0.698]; P<0.001). 5 There was no statis- tically signi ﬁcant difference in the risk of ischemic events between groups. The ENTRUST-AF PCI (Edox- aban Treatment vs Vitamin K Antagonist in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Un dergoing Percutaneous Cor- onary Intervention) trial showed that edoxaban-based regimens were noninferior to VKA-based regimens in terms of clinically relevant bleeding after PCI. 3 An important limitation of the aforementioned data is that most studies compared DOACs monotherapy against VKA plus aspirin, the only VKA-based dual antith- rombotic therapy (DAT) regimen was available in AUGUSTUS trial, thus providing limited information in comparison to DOAC-based DAT regimens available in all trials. 5 2. RCTs have supported DAT with OAC and a P2Y12 in- hibitor over triple therapy with OAC, P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin to reduce the risk of clinically relevant bleeding in patients with AF after PCI, including WOEST (What Is the Optimal Antiplatelet and Antico- agulant Therapy in Patients with Oral Anticoagulation and Coronary Stenting) (VKA), PIONEER AF-PCI (rivaroxaban), RE-DUAL (dabigatran), and AUGUSTUS (apixaban). 1,2,4,6 A meta-analysis of PIONEER AF-PCI, RE-DUAL, and AUGUSTUS demonstrated a 40% rela- tive risk reduction for In ternational Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding in dual therapy regimens compared with triple therapy (OR, 0.598 [95% CI, 0.491-0.727]; P<0.001). 5 Patients in the intervention group received varying duration of triple therapy with aspirin after PCI up to 7 days. This meta- analysis showed that DAT with DOAC and P2Y12 in- hibitor was associated with an increased risk of stent thrombosis (OR, 1.672 [ 95% CI, 1.022-2.733]; P¼0.041) compared with triple therapy. 5 This ﬁnding was mainly driven by outcomes in the 110-mg dosing group of dabigatran in the RE-DUAL trial. The number needed to treat for International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding (n ¼42) was substantially lower than the number needed to harm for stent thrombosis (n ¼223) with DAT compared with triple therapy. 5 Based on these ﬁndings, extended triple therapy up to 30 days after PCI is a consideration when the perceived risk of stent thrombosis is high (eg, complex revascularization, multivessel PCI, previous history of stent thrombosis). 6.8.2. Chronic Coronary Disease (CCD) Recommendation for CCD Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 B-R 1. In patients with AF and CCD (beyond 1 year after revascularization or CAD not requiring coronary revascularization) without history of stent throm bosis, oral anticoagulat ion monotherapy is recom- mended over the combination therapy of OAC and single APT (aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitor) to decrease the risk of major bleeding. 1-3 Synopsis APT is the ﬁrst-line therapy to prevent recurrent cardiovascular events in patients with CAD, while anticoagulation therapy is recommended to prevent stroke or systemic embolism in patients with AF at increased risk of thromboembolism. Minimal evidence was available until recently if a combination therapy of APT in addition to OAC therapy provides additional value to prevent cardiovasc ular events in patients with AF and concomitant CCD (at least 12 months after revascularization or CAD not requiring coronary revascularization) compared with oral anticoagulation monotherapy. A recent landmark clinical trial showed that rivaroxaban monotherapy signi ﬁcantly decreased the primary composite outcome (stroke, systemic em- bolism, MI, unstable angina requiring revascularization, or death from any cause) and decreased the risk of major bleeding compared with the combination ther- apy. 1 The subgroup analysis of the previously mentioned clinical trial in patients with AF only after coronary stenting and another clinical trial corroborated the main ﬁndings in a similar population. 2,3 JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 167 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. An RCT compared the rivaroxaban monotherapy (n¼1107) with the combination of rivaroxaban and a single APT (n¼1,108) in patients with AF and CCD or CAD not requiring revascularization. 1 The primary ef- ﬁcacy outcome was the composite of stroke, systemic embolism, MI, unstable angina requiring revasculari- zation, or death from any cause. Rivaroxaban mono- therapy was noninferior to dual therapy for the primary outcome (4.14% versus 5.75%/patient-year; HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.55-0.95]) and was superior for primary safety endpoint of major bleeding (1.62% versus 2.76%/pa- tient-year; HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.39-0.89]) compared with combination therapy. Another clinical trial also showed the composite outcome of death from all causes, MI, stroke, or systemic embolism (15.7% versus 13.6%; HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.79-1.72]; P¼0.20 for noninferiority); the major bleeding risk in the oral anticoagulation mono- therapy group was numerically lower than the combi- nation therapy group (7.8% versus 10.4%; HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.44-1.20]). 2 However, this trial was termi- nated prematurely because of slow enrollment and did not have enough power for noninferiority; thus, it was inconclusive. Of note, both clinical trials excluded pa- tients with history of stent thrombosis. Further inves- tigation of oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with a history of stent thrombosis is needed. 6.8.3. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) Recommendation for PAD Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 2a B-NR 1. In patients with AF and concomitant stable PAD, monotherapy oral anticoagulation is reasonable over dual therapy (anticoagulation plus aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitors) to reduce the risk of bleeding.1-5 Synopsis Antiplatelet monotherapy is the standard of care for patients with symptomatic PAD and reasonable in asymptomatic PAD with ankle-brachial index #0.90 to reduce the risk of MI, stroke, and vascular death. 6 The 2016 AHA/ACC PAD guidelines recommend against anti- coagulation for ischemic event risk reduction in the gen- eral PAD population (COR 3; LOE A) due to increased risk of bleeding without signi ﬁcant reduction in ischemic events compared with antiplatelet monotherapy, 6,7 without making speci ﬁc recommendations for patients with comorbid PAD and AF. Conversely, anticoagulation is recommended for patients with AF at intermediate-to- high risk of stroke due to the inferiority of APT to pre- vent stroke and systemic thromboembolism in this popu- lation. Subgroup analysis of landmark DOAC clinical trials demonstrate comparable ef ﬁcacy and safety of DOACs compared with warfarin among patients with AF with and without PAD. 2-4 Clinical trial evidence is lacking to guide decisions regarding DAT in the setting of concomitant AF and PAD (whether stable PAD or after lower extremity revascularization). Observational studies of patients with concomitant AF and PAD treated with OAC monotherapy compared with dual therapy (OAC plus antiplatelet) found an increased risk of bleeding on dual therapy without reduction in major adverse cardiac events. 5,8 However, an important limitation of these studies was the lack of PAD- speci ﬁc outcomes such as acute or critical limb ischemia, revascularization, or amputation as primary or secondary outcomes. 5,8 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In the WAVE (Warfarin Antiplatelet Vascular Evalua- tion) trial of patients with PAD but without AF, dual therapy (antiplatelet plus warfarin) did not reduce the primary outcome of MI, stroke, cardiovascular death (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.73-1.16]; P¼0.48) compared with monotherapy (antiplatelet alone), and dual therapy increased the risk of life-threatening bleeding (RR, 3.41 [95% CI, 1.84-6.35]; P<0.001). 7 Meta-analysis of 3 RCT subgroup analyses (ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, ARISTOTLE, ROCKET AF; total N¼2,564) compared safety and ef ﬁ- cacy outcomes between warfarin and DOACs in patients with concomitant AF and PAD. 1-4 The meta-analysis demonstrated similar ef ﬁcacy for DOACs compared with warfarin, including stroke and systemic embolism (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.61-1.42]; P¼0.73), all-cause death (RR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.70-1.19]; P¼0.50), and MI (RR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.64-1.90]; P¼0.74), without a statistically signi ﬁcant difference in the risk of major bleeding (RR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.70-1.81]; P¼0.63) or ICH (RR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.16-1.85]; P¼0.33). 1 In ORBIT-AF II (The Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibril- lation II), 5 among AF patients with concomitant vascular disease (CAD or PAD), major adverse cardiac or neurological events and bleeding events were compared Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 168 between patients on OAC monotherapy versus dual therapy (OAC plus APT). Major adverse cardiac or neurological events (HR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.00-2.25]) did not differ signi ﬁcantly between mono- and dual therapy, while dual therapy was associated with an increased risk of bleeding (HR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.38-3.73];P¼0.001). 5 6.8.4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)/Kidney Failure Recommendations for CKD/Kidney Failure Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-R 1. For patients with AF at elevated risk for stroke and CKD stage 3, treatment with warfarin or, preferably, evidence-based doses of direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitors (Table 19) is recommended to reduce the risk of stroke.1-3 2a B-NR 2. For patients with AF at elevated risk for stroke and CKD stage 4, treatment with warfarin or labeled doses of DOACs is reasonable to reduce the risk of stroke.4,5 2b B-NR 3. For patients with AF at elevated risk for stroke and who have end-stage CKD (CrCl<15 mL/min) or are on dialysis, it might be reasonable to prescribe warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0) or an evidence-based dose of apixaban for oral anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke. 6,7 Synopsis CKD is a risk factor for stroke in patients with AF, in- dependent of other risk factors. 8 T h ep r e v a l e n c eo fA F among patients with renal failure on dialysis is high, including asymptomatic AF.9 Despite compelling evidence in the general population, con ﬂicting data exist as to whether AF is a risk factor for stroke in patients on dial- ysis. 10,11 Potential explanations for this discrepancy include competing risks of stroke and mortality, a high prevalence of undiagnosed AF in cohorts thought not to have AF, and the confounding effect of anticoagulation thrice weekly during hemodialysis. 12 VKAs are limited by a markedly reduced time in therapeutic range in patients with severe CKD, including those on dialysis,13 and asso- ciation with calciphylaxis. 14 The pivotal DOAC trials excluded patients on dialys is, and recommendations for dosing are based on pharmacokinetic data only. Early experience with dabigatran and rivaroxaban in this pop- ulation suggested an increased risk of bleeding relative to warfarin, driven by the higher dose of each. 15 Only dabi- gatran is substantially removed by dialysis.16 As m a l lR C T and a retrospective population-based cohort study found a lower risk of thromboembolism with rivaroxaban versus warfarin, 17,18 but these ﬁndings await con ﬁrmation in larger studies. Limited data on LAAO exist in this group of patients, and prospective comparison to anticoagulation or no therapy is awaited. 19 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Early trials demonstrati n gt h er o l eo fw a r f a r i na n t i - coagulation in preventing stroke did not enroll or separately report outcomes in patients with CKD. An analysis of the SPAF III trial showed that dose-adjusted warfarin, compared with ﬁxed low-dose warfarin plus aspirin, reduced the risk of stroke with a similar magnitude to patients with normal kidney function. 3 In the AVERROES trial of apixaban versus aspirin in pa- tients deemed unsuitable for warfarin, apixaban showed similar ef ﬁcacy in patients with an estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) of 25 to 50 mL/min as those with an eGFR >50 mL/min. 20 Patients with CKD stage 3, which includes those with an eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min, were enrolled in the pivotal trials of the DOACs and showed similar results compared with warfarin as seen in patients with normal kidney function. 2 2.

AF in VHD Recommendations for AF in VHD Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-R 1. In patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis or mitral stenosis of moderate or greater severity and history of AF, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended over DOACs, independent of the CHA2DS2- VASc score to prevent cardiovascular events, including stroke or death.1 1 B-NR 2. In patients with AF and valve disease other than moderate or greater mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, DOACs are recommended over VKAs.2-8 Synopsis At least one-third of patients with AF have some degree of VHD.

VKAs are the anticoagulation drugs of choice for patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, mechanical heart valves, and new-onset AF within 3 months after mechanical aortic or mitral valve surgery. 10 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Historical data have reported that in patients with mitral stenosis and AF, stroke risk was nearly 18-fold higher than an age-, sex-, and hypertension-matched population without AF. 11 More recently, stroke or sys- temic embolism rates ranged between 0.4 and 4 per 100 patient-years among anticoagulated patients and were highest in those with previous embolism. Warfarin is generally prescribed, but it has been questioned whether a DOAC may be an alternative. A retrospective cohort study from Korea examined 2,230 individuals with mitral stenosis and AF who were prescribed either warfarin or a DOAC, using propensity matching on 10 clinical variables. Thromboembolic events in the DOAC group were 2.22% per year compared with 4.19% per year in the warfarin group (HR, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.18- 0.45]). 12 However, in the INVICTUS (The Investigation of Rheumatic AF Treatment Using VKAs, Rivaroxaban or Aspirin Studies) RCT, 1 patients with AF, rheumatic heart disease, and mitral stenosis had a mean survival time to a primary outcome event of stroke, systemic embolism, MI, or death from vascular or unknown c a u s eo f1 , 6 7 5d a y si ft r e a t e dw i t haV K Ac o m p a r e dw i t h 1,599 days if with rivaroxaban (difference, –76 days [95% CI, –121 to –31]; P<0.001). 2. Although patients with moderate to severe mitral ste- nosis or mechanical valve were excluded from DOAC Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 170 trials, other forms of VHD were allowed, such as aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation. Bioprosthetic valves and valve repair were allowed in the edoxaban (ENGAGE AF) and apixaban (ARISTOTLE) trials, and valve repair in the rivaroxaban (ROCKET AF) trial. A systematic re- view 13 of patients with VHD (other than moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical valve) concluded that DOACs were safe. A meta-analysis conﬁrmed that DOACs decreased the risk of stroke/systemic embolism compared with warfarin in patients with (HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.58-0.86]) and without VHD (HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.75- 0.95]). 14 However, for patients with mechanical heart valves, 15 the RE-ALIGN (Randomized, Phase II Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Oral Dabigatran Etexilate in Patients After Heart Valve Replacement) 10 trial was halted during phase II after enrolling 252 subjects due to increased thromboembo- lism and bleeding in the dabigatran arm. PROACT Xa (A Trial to Determine if Participants with an On-X Aortic Valve Can be Maintained Safely on Apixaban) was also terminated early due to higher thromboembolic events with apixaban in patients who were >3m o n t h sa f t e r mechanical On-X aortic valves. 6.8.6. Anticoagulation of Typical AFL Recommendations for Anticoagulation of Typical AFL * Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. For patients with AFL, anticoagulant therapy is recommended according to the same risk proﬁle used for AF.1-3 1 C-LD 2. In patients with AFL who undergo successful cardioversion or ablation resulting in restoration of sinus rhythm, anticoagulation s hould be continued for at least 4 weeks postprocedure.1-4 1A 3. Patients with typical AFL who have undergone successful CTI ablation and have had AF previously detected before AFL ablation should receive ongoing oral anticoagulation posta blation as indicated for AF.5,6 1 B-NR 4. Patients with typical AFL who have undergone successful CTI ablation and are deemed to be at high thromboembolic risk, without any known previous history of AF, should receive close follow-up and arrhythmia monitoring to detect silent AF if they are not receiving ongoing anticoagulation in view of signi ﬁcant risk of AF.7-9 2b B-NR 5. In patients with typical AFL who have undergonesuccessful CTI ablation without any known previous history of AF who are at high risk for development ofAF (eg, LA enlargement, inducible AF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], HF), it may be reasonable to prescribe long-term anticoagulation if thromboembolic risk assessment suggests high risk (>2% annual risk) for stroke.5,10-13 *This section refers to typical right-sided (CTI-dependent) AFL. Left-sided AFLs or atrial tachycardias (ATs) that develop after ablation of AF should be anticoagulated and managed in a manner similar to AF.“Typical” AFL is deﬁned as either typical counterclockwise AFL when the macroreentrant circuit is dependent on the CTI using the isthmus from the patient’s right to left or typical clockwise AFL when the macroreentrant circuit is dependent on the CTI and uses this isthmus from the patient’s left to right.“Atypical” AFL is not dependent on the CTI and may arise from a macroreentrant circuit in the LA, such as perimitral or LA roofﬂutter or could be dependent on scar from previous ablation or surgery. Synopsis AFL is a common atrial arrhythmia with a reported overall incidence of 88 per 100,000 person-years, and the incidence increases with age. 14 AFL is 2.5 times more c o m m o ni nm e nt h a ni nw o m e n ,a n di ti ss i g n iﬁcantly more likely to occur in patients with underlying HF or COPD.14 Because of the high success rate and low recurrence rate of typical AFL after CTI ablation, catheter ablation is often used as a ﬁrst-line treatment. The high effectiveness of CTI ablation may decrease thromboembolic risk so that many physicians may elect to discontinue oral anti- coagulation >1 month after ablation in the absence of previously detected AF. However, the high incidence of new onset AF at some time after CTI ablation places this practice in question. Because AF may be subclinical or asymptomatic, patients could be at signi ﬁcant risk of thromboembolic events after ablation of typical AFL depending on thromboembolic risk factors. Catheter ablation of non –CTI-dependent AFL is tech- nically more difﬁcult, and “atypical ” AFL or AT often oc- curs after AF ablation. Th ese arrhythmias should be anticoagulated and managed in a manner similar to AF. Recommendations in this section refer to treatment of “typical ” AFL. JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 171 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. AFL is associated with increased thromboembolic risk, but the exact risk and beneﬁt of oral anticoagulation are difﬁcult to ascertain as AFL and AF often coexist. In a population-based retrospective cohort study of pa- tients with typical AFL and no history of AF, stroke occurred in 4.1% of patients with AFL compared with 1.2% of a general population-matched cohort (P<0.001). 1 However, no large, randomized trials spe- ciﬁcally address thromboembolic risks and bene ﬁts of anticoagulation in patients who have only AFL. In patients referred for ablation of typical AFL without adequate previous appropriate anticoagulation, and no previous history of AF, TEE showed evidence for LA thrombus or dense spontaneous echocardiographic contrast in 3%. 2 A systematic review identiﬁed thrombo- embolic event rates of 0% to 6% with cardioversion, with the highest incidence of thromboembolic events occurring 1 to 2 days postcardioversion of AFL.3 Echocardiographic studies reported LA thrombus in 0% to 38% and sponta- neous echocardiographic contrast in 21% to 28% of cases. 3 In 1 ablation study, thromboembolic events occurred in 13.9% of patients who did not receive anticoagulation.3 Observational studies report an elevated risk of stroke with AFL compared with a control group (RR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.35-1.46]) and elevated mortality risk (risk ratio, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.2-3.1]) with long-term follow-up. 3 2. The incidence of embolism after cardioversion of AFL is similar to that of AF (0.72% versus 0.46%; P¼not signi ﬁcant). 4 Atrial stunning has been noted on TEE in patients undergoing cardioversion of AF, with partial atrial recovery 15 to 30 days and full recovery 30 to 90 days postcardioversion. 15 LAA stunning also occurs in patients with AFL, although it appears to occur at a lesser degree than what is seen with AF. 16 Although limited data are available for AFL, 1 study demon- strated more forceful mechanical LAA contraction and absence of spontaneous echocardiographic contrast 2 weeks after ablation of persistent AFL, suggesting earlier recovery. 17 Because LA and LAA stunning are thought to contribute to thrombus formation and thromboembolic events after cardioversion, continued anticoagulation is recommended early after conversion to sinus rhythm.

In a meta-analysis, the subsequent incidence of AF after ablation of CTI-dependent AFL was 34% over 14 months. However, the incidence of AF after ﬂutter ablation is signi ﬁcantly higher in patients with a his- tory of AF before ablation than those without AF before ablation (53% versus 23% after 16-18 months;P<0.05). 5 The incidence of AF continues to increase over time in both patients with and without previous AF. 5 Oral anticoagulation reduces risk of stroke or systemic thromboembolism in the setting of nonvalvular AF. 6 Because AF is not necessarily reduced after ablation of AFL, continued anticoagulation is recommended based on thromboembolic risk assessment. The acute success rate for catheter ablation typical AFL is reported to be 92% with a single procedure and 97% with multiple procedures in a meta-analysis. 18 However, the subsequent incidence of AF occurring af- ter ablation of CTI-dependent AFL is reported to be 16% to 82%, 5,10,11 with a higher incidence in patients with a history of AF before ablation than those without (53% versus 23% after 16-18 months; P<0.05). 5 In 1 study, 82% of patients who underwent typical AFL ablation experienced new-onset AF during long-term follow-up (mean, 39 months). 11 4. Because of the high rate of occurrence of new-onset AF after CTI ablation, close follow-up and monitoring are recommended. In patients undergoing AFL ablation, the detection of AF in patients without previous AF signi ﬁcantly increased with more frequent monitoring and/or longer duration of follow-up. 7 This is especially important in patients at high risk of stroke or thromboembolism ( >2%/year). Intermittent moni- toring may be performed with ambulatory monitors or wearable devices. Alternatively, implantable devices can provide more prolonged and continuous moni- toring. Implantable cardiac monitors have been used in multiple settings to detect AF, including after AF ablation or in patients with cryptogenic stroke. Implantable cardiac monitors have also been used for surveillance after AF ablation. 9 5. Factors that predict AF afterﬂutter ablation include LA enlargement, 19-21 inducible AF at the time of ﬂutter ablation, 22,23 interatrial conduction time, 24 prolonged HV interval, 25 COPD, 26 obstructive sleep apnea, 20 and HATCH (hypertension, age $75 years, TIA or stroke, COPD, heart failure) score. 21 One study that reported new-onset AF in 38% of patients after AFL ablation demonstrated a thromboembolic event rate of 10% during a mean follow-up of 5 years. 12 In a Danish reg- istry of patients undergoing ﬂutter ablation, 5% of patients suffered a stroke, and 10% died during a mean follow-up of 4 years. 13 Thus, patients who undergo successfulﬂutter ablation are not free from thromboembolic complications during long-term follow-up, likely due to a high rate of devel- opment of new-onset AF. 7. RATE CONTROL 7.1. Broad Considerations for Rate Control Recommendations for Broad Considerations for Rate Control Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. In patients with AF, SDM with the patient is recommended to discuss rhythm- versus rate-control stra- tegies (taking into consideratio n clinical presentation, comorb idity burden, medication pro ﬁle, and pa- tient preferences), discuss therapeutic options, and for assessing long-term beneﬁts.1-3 2a B-R 2. In patients with AF without HF who are candidates forselect rate-control strategies, heart rate target should be guided by underlying patient symptoms, in general aiming at a resting heart rate of<100 to 110 bpm.2,4-6 Synopsis Rate control is a suitable strategy for many patients with AF.1,3 A solitary randomized trial has evaluated the optimal heart rate among patients with AF. In the RACE II study (Rate Control Efﬁcacy in Permanent Atrial Fibrilla- tion: A Comparison Between Lenient Versus Strict Rate Control II), 614 patients with permanent AF were randomly assigned to either lenient rate control (resting heart rate <110 bpm) or strict rate control (heart rate,<80 bpm). A difference was not seen regarding either the pri- mary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for HF, stroke, systemic embolism, bleeding, and life-threaten ing arrhythmic events (abso- lute difference of –2.0 percentage points [90% CI, –7.6 to JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 173 3.5; P<0.001] for the noninferiority margin) 2 or the sec- ondary outcome of QOL 7 at 3 years. These data suggest heart rate control intensity is not a central determinant of clinical outcomes. However, interpretation is limited by a difference of only 10 bpm between study groups attrib- utable to the proportion of patients assigned to strict control who did not achieve target rate control (32.6%; n¼98/301) and because 78% of lenient rate control par- ticipants having heart rate <100 bpm. 8 In addition, because patients with HF were underrepresented, whether the results can be extrapolated to those with HF is unknown. Nonrandomized data focused on target heart rate among outpatients, 4,9,10 as well as those with HF,5,11-16 are divergent. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Rate- and rhythm-control strategies have comparable clinical outcomes in many patients with AF. In the AFFIRM (Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management) study, rate control was compa- rable to cardioversion and antiarrhythmic drugs regarding survival (HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.99-1.34]; P¼0.08). 1 In the HOT CAFE (How to Treat Chronic Atrial Fibrillation) trial, rate control was comparable to car- dioversion and use of antiarrhythmic drugs with respect to a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, number of thromboembolic events, or major bleeding (OR, 1.98 [95% CI, 0.28-22.3]; P>0.71). 6 In a meta- analysis of randomized trials and observational studies comparing rhythm wi th rate control, manage- ment strategies were comparable with respect to all- cause (OR, 1.34 [95% CI, 0.89-2.02]) and cardiac mor- tality (OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.77-1.20]) as well as stroke (OR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.76-1.30]). 3 Although selection of a rhythm-control therapy within a year of AF diagnosis may be considered to reduce the risk of adverse car- diovascular outcomes, 17 early rate control may still be appropriate as a function of clinical presentation, co- morbidity burden, medication pro ﬁle, and patient preferences. In this context, providers should partner with their patients to select a value-concordant approach within an SDM framework. 2. In RACE II, rate-control intensity (target resting heart rate, <110 bpm versus <80 bpm) did not in ﬂuence cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. 6,18 Rate control (AFFIRM: goal heart rate, #80 bpm at rest and #110 bpm during a 6-minute walk test; HOT CAFE: 70-90 bpm at rest and#140 bpm with moderate exercise) has been shown to be comparable to rhythm control in a meta-analysis of 5 trials, yet some limitation of the studies include that most patients had well-tolerated persistent AF or high risk of recurrence, no long-term follow-up, and should not be extrapolated to patients with paroxysmal AF, highly symptomatic, or patients with HF. 1 Observational data among outpatients and those with HF are conﬂicting. 4 In the ORBIT-AF trial, increasing heart rate was associated with higher all- cause mortality 9 and incident HF.10 Whether a lenient r a t e - c o n t r o ls t r a t e g ym a yb es a f e l ya n de f f e c t i v e l yu s e d in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) 5,14 or reduced fraction 11-13 ,15,16 has also shown conﬂicting results. Other populations that may beneﬁt from a low heart rate goal include those with rate-related cardiac dysfunction, 19 ICDs, 20 cardiac resynchronization therapy, 21 and tachycardia- bradycardia form of sick sinus syndrome22 (Table 20). 7.2. Speciﬁc Pharmacological Agents for Rate Control The overall goals for rate control in patients with both acute and chronic AF with a rapid ventricular response center on control of symptoms and the risk of developing LV systolic dysfunction. In ge neral, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem and verapamil) and beta blockers are the standard of care in rate-controlling AF. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers slow conduction through the atrioventricular node and have negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. These agents are useful in ventricular rate control in the absence of preexcitation. They provide reasonable rate control and also improve AF-related symptoms compared with beta blockers. 1,2 Beta blockers also slow conduction through the atrioventricular node by blocking beta-1 receptors. Digoxin is a time-honored medication for patients with AF particularly among patients with HFrEF due to its positive inotropic and vagotonic effects. Limited data exist directly comparing rate-contr ol agents, especially in the setting of long-term rate control. Selection of speci ﬁc agents should consider patient-speci ﬁcc h a r a c t e r i s t i c s and response. This section will outline the principles of treatment for acute and long-term rate control.

In patients with AF with rapid ventricular response who are hemodynamically stable, beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem; provided that EF >40%) are recom- mended for acute rate control (Figure 17).1-4 2a B-R 2.

JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 175 Synopsis Controlling the ventricular rate in AF with a rapid ventricular response in the acute setting can vary effec- tiveness for control of symptoms. It can also present challenges, given some agents may or may not be preferable in the context of underlying comorbidities given the myriad of contributing factors. For patients requiring intravenous rate-control agents, hypotension and/or the presence of decompensated HF may limit use of otherwise ef ﬁcacious agents. In the acute setting, recognizing patients needing emergency cardioversion is important. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigated the safety and ef ﬁcacy of continuous intravenous diltiazem infusion for 24-hour heart rate control during AF and AFL. Seventeen of the 23 pa- tients (74%) receiving diltiazem infusion and none of the 21 with placebo infusion maintained a therapeutic response for 24 hours. Over 24 hours, patients receiving diltiazem infusion lost response signiﬁcantly more slowly than did those receiving placebo infusion. In another RCT, patients were randomly assigned in 1:1:1 ratio to receive intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, or amiodarone for ventricular rate control. At 24 hours, rate control was achieved in 119 of 150 patients (79%). T h et i m et or a t ec o n t r o lw a ss i g n iﬁcantly shorter among patients in the diltiazem group, with the per- centage of patients who achieved rate control being higher in the diltiazem group (90%) than the digoxin group (74%) and the amiodarone group (74%). A ran- domized, parallel, open-label study aimed to investi- gate esmolol versus verapamil in the acute treatment of AF or AFL. The heart rate signiﬁcantly declined with esmolol and verapamil. Fifty percent of esmolol- treated patients with new onset of arrhythmias con- verted to sinus rhythm, whereas only 12% of those who received verapamil converted. Mild hypotension was observed in both treatment groups. 2. The use of intravenous digoxin has been shown to be effective in controlling the rate of rapid AF compared with placebo in 1 multicenter RCT. 5 However, other a g e n t sm a yb es a f e ra n dm o r ee f f e c t i v ei na c h i e v i n g acute rate control.

Another RCT of 30 patients ran- domized patients with AF and a rapid ventricular response to either intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, or a combination of both agents. Treatment with intrave- nous diltiazem signi ﬁcantly decreased heart rate within 5 minutes versus 3 hours with intravenous digoxin. 7 Intravenous diltiazem reduced heart rate more rapidly than intravenous digoxin in a double- blinded RCT in 40 patients with rapid AF after CABG, with similar control at 12 to 24 hours. In another RCT of 84 patients in rapid AF who presented to the emer- gency department, intravenous amiodarone resulted in faster control of the ventricular response compared with intravenous digoxin. 8 Finally, 52 patients with rapid AF were randomized to receive either an intra- venous combination of diltiazem and digoxin or intravenous diltiazem alone, with a more rapid and d u r a b l er e s p o n s et ot h ec o m b i n a t i o n . 9 3. In addition to atrioventricular nodal blockers and an- tiarrhythmics, intravenous magnesium has been investigated for rate controlling rapid AF. 10,11 The mechanism likely stems from blockade of slow inward calcium channels in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular node, thereby slowing the heart rate and prolonging atrioventricular conduction velocity, respectively. 16 Its low adverse effect proﬁle and minimal toxicity make it a favorable option, often as an adjunct to conventional therapy (ie, atrioventricular nodal blockers). A meta- analysis including 6 RCTs (n ¼745 patients) investi- gated the effectiveness of intravenous magnesium in r a t ea n dr h y t h mc o n t r o lo fr a p i dA Fw h e na d m i n i s t e r e d in combination with standard rate-control methods (including beta blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, digoxin), as well as placebo.

Intravenous amiodarone has been shown to be effective in controlling ventricular rates in patients who are critically ill. In a retrospective study of 38 patients admitted to the intensive care unit, intra- venous amiodarone was associated with a statistically signi ﬁcant decrease in heart rate without decrease in BP compared with intravenous diltiazem and digoxin. 12 One study of 60 critically ill patients, predominantly with AF, with heart rate consistently >120 bpm randomized patients to 1 of 3 intravenous treatment regimens: diltiazem in a 25-mg bolus fol- lowed by a continuous infusion of 20 mg/h for 24 hours; amiodarone in a 300-mg bolus; and amiodar- one in a 300-mg bolus followed by 45 mg/h for 24 hours. 13 A >30% rate reduction within 4 hours was not statistically different in either treatment arm, with less effective control more frequently observed in those receiving a bolus of amiodarone alone; thus overall, diltiazem allowed for signi ﬁcantly better heart rate control over 24 hours, but it also caused a signi ﬁcantly higher incidence of hypotension requiring discontinuation of the drug. 5. Limited data exist regarding the use of non- dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in patients with HFrEF, due to the presumed limitation of nega- tive inotropic effects. Two retrospective analyses highlight potential for increased morbidity when administered in this population. In a retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized with AF with rapid ventricular rate (RVR), dil tiazem was associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury within 48 hours of initiation of diltiazem in those patients with LVEF #50%, compared with those with normal EF (10% versus 3.6%; P¼0.002). 14 An additional retrospective analysis compared patients with HFrEF receiving either intravenous metoprolol or diltiazem. There was a higher incidence of worsening HF symptoms (increased oxygen requirement within 4 hours or initiation of inotropic support with 48 hours) in those patients receiving diltiazem (33% versus 15%; P¼0.019). Neither analysis noted an increase in the in- hospital mortality rate, need for a higher level of care, or hypotension.

Long-Term Rate Control Synopsis Both nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) and beta blockers are effective for long-term rate control. These agents are useful in ventricular rate control in the absence of preexcitation. Digoxin may be useful in patients with limited tolerability to other agents, or as adjunct therapy in patients with a difﬁcult to control ventricular rate. Limited data exist comparing various rate control agents, especially in the setting of chronic rate control. Selection of speciﬁca g e n t s should consider patient-speci ﬁc characteristics (ie, HFrEF, reactive airway disease) and response (Figure 18). Recommendations for Long-Term Rate Control Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. In patients with AF, beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) are recommended for long-term rate control with the choice of agent according to underlying substrate and comorbid conditions. 1,2 2a B-NR 2. For patients with AF in whom measuring serum digoxin levels is indicated, it is reasonable to target levels <1.2 ng/mL.3-6 2a B-R 3. In patients with AF and HF symptoms, digoxin is reasonable for long-term rate control in combination with other rate-controlling agents, or as monotherapy if other agents are not preferred, not tolerated, or contraindicated. 7-9 3: Harm C-LD 4. In patients with AF and LVEF<40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel –blocking drugs should not be administered given their potential to exacerbate HF. 10,11 3: Harm B-R 5. In patients with permanent AF who have risk factors for cardiovascular events, dronedarone should not be used for long-term rate control.12 FIGURE 18 AF Long-Term Rate Control Colors correspond toTable 2.

Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 178 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. One prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, crossover study compared the effect of 4 rate- reducing once-daily drug regimens on the ventricular heart rate and arrhythmia-related symptoms in pa- tients with permanent AF. The 24-hour mean heart rate was 96/C6 12 bpm at baseline (no treatment), 75/C6 10 bpm with diltiazem, 81/C6 11 bpm with verapamil, 82/C6 11 bpm with metoprolol, and 84 /C6 11 bpm with carvedilol. All drugs signi ﬁcantly reduced the heart rate compared with baseline. 13 In a retrospective cohort study, in- vestigators used a database from 2 urban emergency departments to identify consecutive patients with emergency department discharge diagnoses of AF. A total of 259 consecutive patients were enrolled, with 100 receiving calcium channel blockers and 159 receiving beta blockers. Baseline demographics and comorbidities were similar. Twenty-seven percent of patients taking beta blockers were admitted, 31.0% of patients taking calcium channel blockers were admitted, and there were no signiﬁcant differences in emergency department length of stay, adverse events, or 7- or 30-day emergency department revisits. A follow-up analysis of the AFFIRM study examined the difference in all hospitalization and all-cause mortality in participants treated with a single rate-control agent at baseline. No difference was found among those participants receiving beta blockers, non- dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or digoxin. 2 2. Seminal work investigating digoxin toxicity was based on a small series of patients, where toxicity was determined by electrocardiographic abnormalities. 14 Toxicity was seen when serum digoxin concentra- tions exceeded 2.0 ng/mL, and almost certainly at levels >3.0 ng/mL. Based on this small study, the narrow therapeutic range of digoxin is usually cited as 0.8 to 2.0 ng/mL, with substantial variation across institutional laboratories and published references. 15,16 However, 3 post hoc analyses of the DIG (Digitalis Investigation Group) trial suggested that safe use of digoxin is seen at lower serum concentrations. 4-6 Serum digoxin concentrations of 0.5 to 0.9 ng/mL were associated with signi ﬁcantly lower all-cause mortality rates and hospitalizations compared with concentrations $1.0 ng/mL. 3 Another analysis sug- gested that serum digoxin concentrations >1.2 ng/mL may be harmful, particularly in women. 7 Ap o s th o c analysis comparing patients with AF taking digoxin with propensity score-matched controls suggested that patients with serum dig oxin concentrations <0.9 ng/ mL had no increased risk of death, concentrations of 0 . 9t o1 . 1n g / m Lh a dan o n s i g n iﬁcant increased risk of death, and serum digoxin concentrations $1.2 ng/mL were associated with a signiﬁcant (56%) increased risk of death. 4 Serum digoxin concentrations of 0.5 to 0.8 ng/mL seem safest in terms of beneﬁtw i t h o u ta d v e r s e e f f e c t si np a t i e n t sw i t hH F r E F .17 3. Digoxin may have added ef ﬁcacy as rate control in conjunction with beta blockers in patients with AF. A small RCT of 47 patients with persistent AF and concomitant HFrEF compared the effects of digoxin alone, carvedilol alone, a nd their combination. 10 Combination therapy was signi ﬁcantly associated with better rate control and symptom relief than monotherapy with either agent. The RATE-AF trial randomized 160 patients with persistent AF and concomitant HFrEF to digoxin and bisoprolol. 11 No signi ﬁcant differences in the primary endpoint of QOL were noted at 6 months with either agent. Several secondary outcomes, including N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level, were signi ﬁcantly lower in the digoxin group, without a signiﬁcant difference in resting heart rate between the 2 groups at 12 months. Adverse effects were less common in the digoxin group. A large meta-analysis of 75 studies and approximately 620,000 patients found a signi ﬁcantly increased risk of death in digoxin users overall but, when limited to 7 RCTs (w8,400 patients), no differ- ence in mortality rate was observed between digoxin or placebo — of note, these 7 RCTs in the subanalysis were in patients with concomitant HF. 9 Ap o s th o cs e n s i - tivity analysis assessing the impact of digoxin on mortality in patients with HF and concomitant AF found no impact on overall mortality in patients taking digoxin, most with HFrEF. 4. MDPIT (Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial) demonstrated an association of worsening HF in pa- tients with a recent MI, with LV dysfunction random- ized to diltiazem. Among those with a baseline EF of <40%, late HF appeared in signi ﬁcantly more pa- tients receiving diltiazem compared with placebo (21% versus 12%; P¼0.004). Life table analysis in patients with an EF of <40% con ﬁrmed signi ﬁcantly more frequent late HF in those taking diltiazem. In addition, the diltiazem-associated rise in the frequency of late congestive heart failure (CHF) was progressively greater with increasingly severe decrements in base- line EF. 10 5. The safety and ef ﬁcacy of dronedarone, originally designed as an antiarrhythmic to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with AF, was addressed in several seminal trials. 18-20 PALLAS (Palbociclib Collaborative Adjuvant Study) was designed to investigate whether dronedarone would reduce major vascular events or hospitalizations in patients with permanent AF. The beneﬁts of dronedarone in patients with permanent AF were initially suggested from the ERATO (Efﬁcacy and JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 179 Safety of Dronedarone for the Control of ventricular rate during atrial ﬁbrillation) trial, which showed a signiﬁ- cant reduction in the ventricular response for patients with paroxysmal and permanent AF in the 24-hour setting, which were carri ed forward in a 6-month follow-up. 12 PALLAS randomized approximately 3,200 patients with permanent AF at high risk for adverse events. The trial was terminated early, because of the strong signal for harm in 43 patients receiving drone- darone versus 19 receiving placebo, namely death (13/21 due to arrhythmia), stroke, and hospitalization for HF. 12 7.3. Atrioventricular Nodal Ablation (AVNA) Recommendations for AVNA Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 C-LD 1. In patients with AF and a persistently rapid ventricular response who undergo AVNA, initial pacemaker lower rate programming should be 80 to 90bpm to reduce the risk of sudden death.1,2 2a B-R 2. In patients with AF and uncontrolled rapid ventricular response refractory to rate-control medications (who are not candidates for or in whom rhythm control has been unsuccessful), AVNA can be useful to improve symptoms and QOL.3-6 1 B-NR 3. In patients with AF who are planned to undergo AVNA, implantation of a pacemaker before the ablation (ie, before or same day of ablation) is recommended to ensure adequacy of the pacing leads before performing ablation. 7-9 2b C-LD 4. In patients with AF with normal EF undergoing AVNA, conduction system pacing of the His bundle10-13 or left bundle area12,13 may be reasonable. Synopsis AVNA provides ventricular ra te control effectively and without medications yet cre ates dependence on pacing. 3 Consideration of the consequences of lifelong pacemaker implantation, particularly with respect to age and comor- bidities, is central to decision-making regarding beneﬁt. Small RCTs of AVNA and right ventricular pacing (RVP) have shown improvements in symptoms and QOL compared with medical rate control alone but found no signiﬁcant differences in EF or other measures of cardiac perfor- mance. 3,14 Progression to persistent AF is described in many patients with previously paroxysmal AF after AVNA. 15,16 Antiarrhythmic drugs reduce the transition to permanent AF but do not improve QOL or echocardiographic parame- ters, and patients treated with antiarrhythmic drugs have more episodes of HF and hospitalizations. 17 Early concerns regarding AVNA included risks for device-related complications, sudden cardiac death, and worsened HF. Deaths due to malignant arrhythmias have been nearly eradicated by programming higher lower-rate pacing in the early postprocedure period. 1,2,18 The risks of HF may be ameliorated by non-RVP strategies, but data are limited in patients who do not have HF before AVNA. 19 Overall, long-term data on outcomes after AVNA are limited, and no evidence supports AVNA as ﬁrst-line therapy. 9 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Early observational studies showed a concerning inci- dence of sudden death after AVNA in 3% to 7% of patients. 20,21 This immediate postprocedural risk results from ventricular ﬁbrillation (VF) predominantly due to bradycardia, QT prolongation, and heterogeneity of repolarization. Initiation of VF is often pause dependent or occurs during a relatively slow pacing rate.18 Deaths due to malignant arrhythmias have been minimized by current protocols specifying higher lower-rate pacing in patients after AVNA in the early postprocedure period. 1,2,18 Subsequent lower rate adjustment is per- formed over the course of several weeks. 2. AVNA and pacemaker implantation provide safe and effective rate control in the fraction of patients with AF who cannot be effectively rate controlled with medical therapy 3,4,22 and in whom sinus rhythm has failed or is not deemed to be effective. A meta-analysis of 6 small RCTs of studies comparing AVNA and pacemaker versus medical therapy or medical therapy with pacemaker including 323 subjects with paroxysmal or persistent AF showed improvement in symptoms and QOL in the AVNA group. 6 No differences in survival, stroke, hos- pitalization, EF, or exercise capacity were found. There was no effect of AVNA on all-cause mortality in a pooled analysis. 6 Nonrandomized studies have shown improvement in a range of clinical outcomes5 in addi- tion to data showing improved EF in patients with suspected tachycardia-rel ated cardiomyopathy after AVNA. 23 These favorable ﬁndings in nonrandomized studies are likely subject to the placebo effect of device implantation. Early and late complication rates are not inconsequential, speci ﬁcally in young patients in view Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 180 of the risk of pacemaker-mediated cardiomyopathy, and long-term follow-up data are scant.9 3. Although few studies concerning AVNA and pacing report complication rates for the pacemaker implant, the overall risk of lead dislodgement or failure is approximately 2%, and many operators perform both AVNA and pacemaker implant during the same pro- cedure. 9,13,24 Practice patterns vary, however, and a European survey indicated up to 80% of operators will choose to perform AVNA 1 to 3 months after pacemaker implantation to reduce risk of adverse outcome due to early lead dislodgement. 25 In the prospective FOL- LOWPACE registry from 23 centers in the Netherlands, lead dislodgment was the most frequent lead-related complication, occurring in 3.3% of patients within the ﬁrst 2 months of implant. 7 Relevant to the older age population usually undergoing AVNA, a pooled patient-level analysis of 4814 subjects from CTOPP (Canadian Trial of Physiologic Pacing), UKPACE (United Kingdom pacing and cardiovascular events), and Danish pacing trials — designed to compare pace- maker implantation complication rates in age <75 y e a r sv e r s u sa g e$75 years— found a higher risk of early complications in those age $75 years (5% versus 3%), driven by a higher rate of lead dislodgement (2%) and pneumothorax (1.6%). 8 If AVNA and pacing are per- formed concomitantly, ideally, leads should be placed ﬁrst to ensure adequate lead function. 4. HF after AVNA is attributed to the deleterious effects of RVP, 26 and risk is correlated with baseline cardiac func- tion.9 The PAVE (Post AV Nodal Ablation Evaluation) trial compared outcomes in patient with persistent AF and uncontrolled rates undergoing AVNA and RVP with AVNA and biventricular pacing (BiVP) and found an improve- ment in 6-minute walk test and EF, but beneﬁtw a sp r e - dominantly seen in subjects with EF<45% or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II to III HF at baseline. 27 Not all patients appear to be at high risk of HF after AVNA and RVP.28 Because the beneﬁti sl e s sa n dt h er i s ko f complications is higher in BiVP compared with conven- tional pacing, RVP is advised in patients with preserved EF undergoing AVNA. 19 Conduction system pacing of the His bundle or left bundle area offers promise to reduce the risk of RVP- induced cardiomyopathy and improve outcomes. Early studies have justiﬁably focused on patients with HF un- dergoing AVNA, and limited data are available in patients with preserved EF and no HF diagnosis. 27 His bundle pacing with AVNA has been shown to be feasible and associated with improvements in EF in patients with EF <40%, and NYHA class, albeit with elevated pacing thresholds. 10,11 Left bundle area pacing may deliver the advantages of His bundle pacing with reduced risk of elevated pacing thresholds or lead dislodgement.12 Early studies have shown stable EF with conduction system pacing and AVNA in follow-up, and improvement in pa- tients with EF<50%. 12,24 8. RHYTHM CONTROL 8.1. Goals of Therapy With Rhythm Control Recommendations for Goals of Therapy With Rhythm Control Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-R 1. In patients with reduced LV function and persistent (or high burden) AF, a trial of rhythm control should be recommended to evaluate whether AF is contributing to the reduced LV function.1-6 2a B-R 2. In patients with symptomatic AF, rhythm control can be useful to improve symptoms.7-11 2a B-R 3. In patients with a recent diagnosis of AF (<1 year), rhythm control can be useful to reduce hospitaliza- tions, stroke, and mortality. 12-14 2a B-R 4. In patients with AF and HF, rhythm control can beuseful for improving symptoms and improving out- comes, such as mortality and hospitalizations for HF and ischemia.15-19 2a B-NR 5. In patients with AF, rhythm-control strategies can be useful to reduce the likelihood of AF progression.20-27 2b C-LD 6. In patients with AF where symptoms associated with AF are uncertain, a trial of rhythm control (eg, cardioversion or pharmacologic al therapy) may be useful to determine what if any symptoms are attributable to AF.28-32 2b B-NR 7. In patients with AF, rhythm-control strategies may be useful to reduce the likelihood of development of dementia or worsening cardiac structural abnormalities. 33-45 JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 181 Synopsis When caring for a patient with AF, deciding between rhythm and rate control is important but critical to acknowledge that the decision is nuanced, can evolve over time, and that the 2 strategies are necessarily not mutually exclusive depending on the deﬁnition used. For example, in EAST-AFNET 4 (Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial), which random- ized patients with recently identi ﬁed AF to rhythm- or rate-control strategies, in those patients randomized to the rhythm control arm, initially 87% were treated with antiarrhythmic drugs and 8% with AF ablation; but, at 2 years, 35% were not on antiarrhythmic drugs or had received AF ablation. 12 Similarly, although the decision on whether to use rhythm control is often based on symp- toms, in a post hoc analysis of the same trial, beneﬁts in the composite outcome of death, stroke, or cardiac hos- pitalization was observed in all patients regardless of whether symptoms were present or not. 30 Data from EAST-AFNET 4 and large registries have consistently demonstrated the importance of monitoring patients for increased AF burden once AF has been identiﬁed and that rhythm-control therapies are more likely to be successful when implemented early when AF burden begins to increase. 13,14,30,46,47 Finally, for all patients with AF, continued long-term management of modi ﬁable risk fac- tors is essential.48 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. AF and reduced LV function are often recognized in the same patient, with the combination being associated with worse prognosis when compared with patients with either HF or AF alone. 1,49 Several studies have demonstrated improved LV function in patients with AF after restoration of sinus rhythm. 2-6 The incidence of AF or other atrial arrhythmias as an important contributor to reduced LVEF is unknown and likely dependent on arrhythmia bu rden, ventricular rates, and other factors. 4-6 However, in patients who present with both AF and reduced LV function or develop reduced LV function after an initial diagnosis of AF, where no identiﬁa b l ec a u s ef o rt h er e d u c e dL Vf u n c - tion is observed, AF should initially be assumed as a very possible cause until proven otherwise. Although AF as a cause for reduced LV function is usually considered in the setting of rapid ventricular rates, improved LV function with rhythm control has been reported in the setting of AF with relatively well controlled heart rates. 2,3 2. Rhythm and rate control can improve symptoms in AF.7,8,50,51 Multiple studies have shown improved QOL with rhythm control.7-9,50,51 Continued symptoms due to AF are common with rate control. In the RACE II study, lenient rate control had similar primary outcomes (a combination of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for HF, and several other endpoints) compared to strict rate control, but at the end of the follow-up period ( >2 years), 46% of patients in both groups had continued symptoms associated with AF. 10 Although a different population, symptoms due to recurrent AF were identiﬁed in 56 of 303 (18%) patients with newly identi ﬁed AF undergoing rhythm control with either AADs or catheter ablation. 11 3. EAST-AFNET 4 randomized 2,733 patients with early onset AF (<1 year) and other risk factors for stroke to rhythm control or rate-control strategies. 12 Rhythm control was associated with a 25% reduction in the combined endpoint of mortality rate, stroke, and hospitalizations due to HF or ACS. In 2 observa- tional studies, 1 from claims data and another from a large national database, when compared with rate control, early initiation of rhythm control (<1y e a r )i n patients with AF was associated with 15% and 19% reductions in the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, ischemic stroke, or hospitalization for ischemia or HF, respectively. 13,14 However, these recent ﬁndings must be balanced against studies that have reported increased emergency department visits and health care resource utilization associated with rhythm control. 52-54 4. In the AF-CHF (Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure) trial, rhythm control did not affect cardiovas- cular mortality but was associated with improved QOL. 15,55 Contemporary trials in patients with AF and HF, regardless of LV function, and often using catheter ablation as an important therapy, have reported trends or statistically signi ﬁcant improvement in clinical outcomes associated with rhythm control when compared to rate control. 16,17,49,56-58 In an analysis of patients with HF in EAST-AFNET 4, rhythm control was associated with a signiﬁc a n tr e d u c t i o ni nt h ec o m p o s - ite primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, stroke, or hospitalization due to HF or acute ischemic syndrome (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.56-0.97]; P¼0.03). 16 Similarly, in the CABANA (Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation) trial, catheter ablation-based rhythm control was associated with a 46% reduction in the mortality rate in patients with HF c o m p a r e dw i t hm e d i c a lt h e r a p y . 19 Although catheter ablation is more effective in maintaining sinus rhythm than antiarrhythmic drugs, maintenance of sinus rhythm was higher in the AF-CHF trial. In this study, amiodarone was the preferential strategy for rhythm control (82% of patients) compared with the ablation- based CASTLE-AF (Catheter Ablation versus Standard Conventional Therapy in Patients with Left Ventricular Dysfunction and Atrial Fibrillation) trial (sinus rhythm at study completion: AF-CHF: 75% versus CASTLE-AF: Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 182 66%), and additionally the beneﬁto fr h y t h mc o n t r o li n patients with HF is likely g reatest in those patients with recently identiﬁed AF.15-18 ,49 5. AF commonly, but not always, progresses over time to higher burdens and becomes more sustained. 20,59 Large registry studies ha ve reported that AF pro- gression is more commonly observed with a rate- control strategy compared t o a rhythm-control strat- egy over a 1- to 2-year period, although the absolute magnitude and difference has varied. For example, in FIGURE 19 Patient and Clinical Considerations for Choos ing Between Rhythm Control and Rate Control Patient and clinical considerations for deciding between rhythm- and rate-control strategies in a patient with a high burden of AF. AF indicates atrial ﬁbrillation; AV, atrioventricular; LA, left atrium; and LV, left ventricular. JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 183 2 registry studies, progression to a more sustained form of AF burden was observed in 26% to 28% of patients undergoing a rate- control strategy compared with 6% to 11% of patients treated with a rhythm- c o n t r o ls t r a t e g yw h i l e ,i na na n a l y s i so ft h eO R B I T AF trial, although rhythm control was associated with a lower likelihood of progression, AF progres- sion was much more common regardless of strategy (66% for rate control and 56% for rhythm control) likely due to older patients in this cohort. 21-23 AF progression is a complex process, and although the choice between rhythm-control and rate-control s t r a t e g yh a sa ni m p a c t ,m a n yo t h e rf a c t o r ss u c ha s age, presence or absence of HF or other comorbidities, LA size, heart rate, and modiﬁable risk factors are also important. 21-27 6. The reported prevalence of asymptomatic AF varies from 10% to 40% depending on study cohort. 28 Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with AF have similar risks for death and stroke. 28,29 In a post hoc analysis of EAST-AFNET 4, similar magnitudes of beneﬁt were observed in symptomatic and asymp- tomatic patients for reducing the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, stroke, and hospitalization for HF. 30 Nevertheless, the evidence base for the beneﬁts of a rhythm-control trial in asymptomatic patients with sinus rhythm is limited. Improved energy with return to sinus rhythm was noted in 1 observational study of FIGURE 20 Flowchart for Treatment Choices When Required to Decrease AF Burden *Younger with few comorbidities. Colors correspond toTable 2. AF indicates atrialﬁbrillation. Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 184 13 asymptomatic patients with persistent AF. 31 In another study that included 18 asymptomatic patients, at 1-month follow-up, no patients had improvement in symptoms, although sinus rhythm was maintained in only 35% of patients. 32 In 2 small studies that focused on the impact of catheter ablation in asymptomatic patients, maintenance of sinus rhythm was associated with improved QOL indices in all patients, but 24% to 34% of patients developed symptoms mainly due to AT after the ablation procedure. 53,54 7. AF is associated with increased cognitive impairment, progressive increase in AF burden, and structural changes in the heart. 33,34 Nonrandomized studies from registries or post hoc analyses of randomized trials have reported that rhythm control is associated with a reduction in the incidence of dementia and develop- ment of HF. 36-38 Furthermore, AF can also be an etio- logic reason for mitral regurgitation or tricuspid regurgitation. 39-45 In 1 study of 53 patients referred for AF ablation with moderate mitral regurgitation or worse, maintenance of sinus rhythm at follow-up was associated with signiﬁcant decreases in LA size, mitral annular dilatation, and mitral regurgitation. 39 In another study, 70% of patients undergoing ablation for AF who maintained sinus rhythm at follow-up had improvement in mitral regurgitation. 40 Similar results have been found in tricuspid valve function as assessed by echocardiography. 42-45 8.2. Electrical and Pharmacological Cardioversion Cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm is a mode of acute rhythm control. Ca rdioversion can be achieved electri- cally or pharmacologically. Electrical cardioversion, given rapidity and ef ﬁcacy, is the treatment of choice for pa- tients with hemodynamic instability attributable to AF. Acute rhythm control with cardioversion should also be considered for patients with hemodynamically stable AF intolerant of atrioventricular dyssynchrony, loss of atrial kick, or unable to achieve adequate rate control. In pa- tients with hemodynamically stable AF, both electrical cardioversion and pharmacological cardioversion are acceptable, safe, and ef ﬁcacious methods for acute rhythm control. 1-3 Electrical cardioversion is more effec- tive than pharmacological cardioversion alone 4,5 but in- volves the trade-off of anesthesia or sedation. 6 Thromboembolic risks and considerations for anti- coagulation apply to both pharmacological cardioversion and electrical cardioversion. 7,8 8.2.1.

COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-R 1. In patients with AF duration of‡48 hours, a 3-week duration of uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation or imaging evaluation to exclude intracardiac thro mbus is recommended before elective cardioversion. 1 1 B-NR 2. In patients with AF undergoing cardioversion, therapeutic anticoagulation shou ld be established before cardioversion and continued for at least 4 weeks afterwards without interruption to prevent thrombo- embolism. 2-7 1 C-LD 3. In patients with AF in whom cardioversion is deferred due to LAA thrombus detected on precardioversion imaging, therapeutic anticoagulation should be instituted for at least 3 to 6 weeks, after which imaging should be repeated before cardioversion. 1,8 2b B-NR 4. In patients with AF and previous LAAO who are not on anticoagulation, imaging evaluation to assess the adequacy of LAAO and exclude device-related thrombosis before cardioversion may be reasonable. 9-19 2b C-LD 5. In patients with AF and previous LAAO with residual leak, pericardioversion anticoagulation may be considered and continued thereafter. 9-11 ,20 2b C-LD 6. In patients with reported AF duration of<48 hours (not in the setting of cardiac surgery) and who are not on anticoagulation, precardiover sion imaging to exclude intracardiac thrombus may be considered in those who are at elevated thromboembolic risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score ‡2o re q u i v a l e n t ) .21,22 2b C-LD 7. In patients with low thromboembolic risks (CHA2DS2-VASc 0-1 or equivalent) and AF duration of<12 hours, the beneﬁt of precardioversion imaging or pericardioversion anticoagulation is uncertain given the low incidence of pericardioversion thromboembolic events in this population. 21,22 JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 185 Synopsis Thromboembolic risks and considerations of anti- coagulation apply to both pharmacological cardioversion and electrical cardioversion. 23,24 Thromboembolic risks in the setting of acute cardioversion relate to preexisting thrombus, change in atrial mechanical function with restoration of sinus rhyt hm, atrial stunning post- cardioversion, and transie nt prothrombotic state. 2,25 DOACs are alternatives to VK As as thromboprophylaxis in the setting of cardioversion. 26-29 Given additional favorable attributes of rapid time to therapeutic efﬁcacy, reliability of maintenance of therapeutic ef ﬁcacy, and ease of continuation, DOACs may be preferentially considered over VKAs for patients with AF planned for cardioversion barring contra indications to DOAC therapy. Precardioversion imaging is prudent for patients with AF who have previously undergone LAAO and are not on anticoagulation. 9,10,14-16 ,19 Thromboembolic risks for pa- tients with <48 hours of AF were not homogenous but, rather, varied by a patient’sr i s kp r oﬁle for thromboem- bolic complications (as de ﬁned by risk scores in speciﬁc studies) and duration of AF.21,22 More nuanced consider- ation of a patient’s thromboembolic risks in the setting of cardioversion for AF may integrate a patient ’ss u b s t r a t e for atrial myopathy and risks for thromboembolism instead of strict dependence on the previously used 48- hour duration threshold.

Early experience with both pharmacological and then electrical cardioversion of AF led to the observation that thromboembolism was less frequent in patients who were chronically anticoagulated than those who were not. 30 This led to an empiric recommendation for 3 weeks of anticoagulation before cardioversion in the prospective, randomized, m ulticenter ACUTE (Assess- ment of Cardioversion Usi ng Transesophageal Echo- cardiography) study of patients with >2d a y s’duration of AF. 31 Precardioversion anticoagulation of at least 3 weeks may be accomplished via either therapeutic anticoagulation with VKAs or DOACs. 26-28 Cardiac computed tomography, particularly with delayed contrast-enhanced image acquisition protocol, has emerged as an alternate imaging modality to exclude intracardiac thrombus. 32-34 2. Rationales for establishment of therapeutic anti- coagulation before cardioversion and continuation for the subsequent 4 weeks after cardioversion for AF are driven by elevated thromboembolic risks, 6,7,35 high early recurrence of AF, 36 and observation of atrial dysfunction 2-5 during this period. Thromboembolic risks are elevated around the time of cardioversion, especially within the 30 days after cardioversion. 6,7 The observation of spontaneous echocardiographic contrast in association with atrial dysfunction on TEE after cardioversion raised mechanistic concerns for atrial stunning in the setting of cardioversion, 2,3 with recovery of mechanical atrial systole over the ensuing 1 month. 4,5 Rapidity of recovery of mechanical atrial systole may be in ﬂuenced by clinical variables, 37 duration of the antecedent AF episode leading to car- dioversion, 5 and the extent of comorbid conditions as risks factors for atrial myopathy.38 3. In patients with AF, detection of intracardiac thrombus should prompt cancellation of planned cardioversion and institution of therapeutic anticoagulation in anti- coagulant-naïve patients. D etection of intracardiac thrombus in patients already on anticoagulation should prompt assessment of compliance, dosing appropriateness, drug absorption, and drug in- teractions. In patients with thrombus detected despite already being anticoagulated, potential reasons should be investigated, such as nonadherence and drug interaction, which may cause subtherapeutic levels. Switching to an alternate anticoagulant can be considered, although the bene ﬁt is uncertain. In anti- coagulant-naïve patients, 61.2% had resolution of thrombus on follow-up TEE performed 3 to 12 weeks after initiation of VKA in the CLOT-AF (Retrospective Registry Providing Baseline Data on the Outcome of Left Atrial [LA] or LA Appendage [LAA] Thrombus in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation [AF] or Atrial Flutter After Standard of Care [SoC] Anticoagu- lant Therapy) study, and 41.5% had resolution of thrombus on follow-up TEE performed 6 weeks after therapy with rivaroxaban in the X-TRA (Exploring the Efﬁcacy of Once Daily Oral Rivaroxaban for Treatment of Thrombus in Left Atrial/Left Atrial Appendage in Subjects With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation or Atrial Flutter) study. 8 Repeat imaging (TEE or computed to- mography 32-34 ) is generally pursued after at least 3 to 6 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation to assess for resolution of intracardiac thrombus before reconsi- dering cardioversion. 1,8 4. In the subset of patients who have undergone surgical or pLAAO procedures, inadequate occlusion may be seen acutely during the procedure or delayed after the procedure. 9-14 Inadequate LAAO has been associated with elevated risks for thromboembolism. 9-11 Device- related thrombosis, repo rted in patients with pLAAO devices, 15-19 has also been associated with elevated stroke/systemic embolism. 15-18 Imaging with TEE or cardiac computed tomography can assess adequacy of LAAO, residual leak, and device-related throm- bosis. 39-41 In the setting of transesophageal echocar- diographic imaging before electrical cardioversion, device-related thrombus was detected in 2.7% (4 of 148 patients) of a small multicenter retrospective Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 186 analysis of patients with Watchman LAAO device. 20 These 4 patients were treated with oral anti- coagulation and after 6 to 8 weeks, on conﬁrmation of thrombus resolution by repeat TEE, underwent suc- cessful electrical cardioversion. 20 5.

The largest to date is a retrospective multi- center study of 148 Watchman LAAO device patients who underwent electrical cardioversion after FIGURE 21 Patients With Hemodynamically Stable AF Planned for Cardioversion Colors correspond toTable 2. AC indicates anticoagulation; AF, atrialﬁbrillation; and LAAO, left atrial appendage occlusion.

Pericardioversion antithrombotic regimen was at the discretion of the treating physi- cians, 20 and the relationship of anticoagulation with presence/absence of small residual leak was not re- ported. Considerations for anticoagulation may also vary based on speci ﬁc surgical or pLAAO procedures and devices. 6. The safety of cardioversion without further assessment or previous anticoagulation in patients with AF dura- tion of <48 hours has been challenged. In addition to concerns for underestima tion of actual duration of episode and burden due to potential for asymptomatic occurrence of AF, emerging data demonstrate that thromboembolic risks in patients with<48 hours of AF were not homogenously low. Time to cardioversion >12 hours has been reported as an independent pre- dictor for thromboembolic complications. 21 As i n g l e - center observational study of patients undergoing cardioversion for AF of <48 hours duration did not observe thromboembolic events in patients with CHA 2DS2-VASc score of 0 or 1 or patients with post- operative AF but noted differential thromboembolic rates in CHA 2DS2-VASc score $2.42 Larger studies similarly demonstrated that among patients with <48 hours of AF, postcardioversion thromboembolic risks increased with increasing CHA 2DS2-VASc score, 22,43 especially in those with CHA 2DS2-VASc score $2i n the absence of anticoagulation. 22 7. Retrospective observational data from the FinCV (Finnish CardioVersion) study noted low incidence of 30-day pericardioversion thromboembolic event rate of 0.4% in patients with AF with CHA 2DS2-VASc of 0 to 122 or 0.3% in patients with duration of <12 hours of AF.21 Other retrospective studies have similarly demonstrated low pericardioversion thromboembolic r i s k si np a t i e n t sw i t hC H A 2DS2-VASc score of 0 to 1.42 The combination of CHA 2DS2-VASc of 0 to 1 in conjunction with duration of <12 hours of AF may identify a population at particularly low risk for peri- cardioversion thromboembolism. 8.2.2. Electrical Cardioversion Recommendations for Electrical Cardioversion Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 C-LD 1. In patients with hemodynamic instability attributable to AF, immediate electrical cardioversion should be performed to restore sinus rhythm.1 1 B-R 2. In patients with AF who are hemodynamically stable, electrical cardioversion can be performed as initial rhythm-control strategy or after unsucc essful pharmacological cardioversion. 2 1 C-LD 3. In patients with AF undergoing electrical cardioversion, energy delivery should be conﬁrmed to be syn- chronized to the QRS to reduce the risk of inducing VF.3 2a B-R 4. For patients with AF undergoing elective electrical cardioversion, the use of biphasic energy of at least 200 J as initial energy can be beneﬁcial to improve success of initial electrical shock.4,5 2a B-NR 5. In patients with AF undergoing elective cardioversion, with longer duration of AF or unsuccessful initial shock, optimization of electrode vector, use of higher energy, and pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs can facilitate success of electrical cardioversion. 5-9 2b C-LD 6. In patients with obesity and AF, use of manual pressure augmentation and/or further escalation of electrical energy may be beneﬁcial to improve success of electrical cardioversion. 10 Synopsis Electrical cardioversion is a strategy for acute rhythm control. Compared with pharm acological cardioversion alone, electrical cardiovers i o nw i t hs y n c h r o n i z e dd i r e c t current cardioversio n is more rapid and ef ﬁcacious for restoring sinus rhythm from AF. 1,11,12 Given rapidity and efﬁcacy, electrical cardioversion is the treatment of choice for patients with hemodynamically unstable AF. In hemodynamically stable patients with AF planned for acute rhythm control, elec trical cardioversion can be performed as an initial strategy or after unsuccessful pharmacological cardioversion. 2,6,13,14 Electrical Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 188 cardioversion is favored over pharmacological cardiover- sion when the patient is able to tolerate sedation, desires more immediate rhythm conversion, or has failed or not met candidacy for pharmacological cardioversion. Although electrical cardioversion may achieve acute restoration of sinus rhythm, durability of sinus rhythm may be inﬂuenced by ongoing acute conditions, LA size, duration of the history of AF and/or speciﬁce p i s o d e ,a n d comorbidities. 14 In patients with a longer duration of AF, immediate recurrence of AF, a previous unsuccessful electrical cardioversion, or a desire to employ all reason- able efforts to avoid an AF recurrence, pretreatment antiarrhythmic drugs and subsequent continuation to facilitate success of acute cardioversion and promote maintenance of sinus rhythm postcardioversion 6,8,9 may be pursued in the context of SDM with the patient. Opti- mization of energy delivery, electrode vector, and reduction of transthoracic impedance with manual pres- sure augmentation may also improve success of electrical cardioversion. 5-10 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In patients with hemodynamically unstable AF, im- mediate electrical cardioversion with synchronized direct current cardioversion is the treatment of choice. Direct data on emergency cardioversion of hemody- namically unstable patients is limited because of the emergency circumstances of the clinical context. Data on direct current cardioversion of AF in hemodynam- ically stable patients demonstrate high success rate of restoring sinus rhythm with direct current cardiover- sion. 1,11,15-18 Electrical cardioversion is rapid. Electrical cardioversion alone is more effective than pharmaco- logical cardioversion alone. 1,11,12 2. Goals of rhythm control are summarized inSection 8.1 (“Goals of Therapy With Rhythm Control ”). Real- world data support both elec trical cardioversion and pharmacological cardioversion as acceptable, safe, and efﬁcacious methods for acute rhythm control. 6,13,14 Electrical cardioversion is more effective than phar- macological cardioversion alone 1,11 but involves the t r a d e - o f fo fr e q u i r i n gs e d a t i o n .19 In patients with he- modynamically stable AF of recent onset, the RAFF2 (Electrical versus pharmac ological cardioversion for emergency department patients with acute atrial ﬁbrillation) study demonstrated high success of resto- ration of sinus rhythm with either an upfront electrical cardioversion strategy or a stepwise strategy with initial pharmacological cardioversion and then direct current cardioversion if the pharmacological inter- vention did not restore sinus rhythm. 2 In patients with unsuccessful pharmacological cardioversion, instead of switching to another antiarrhythmic drug (and with concerns for potentiation of adverse effects such as QT prolongation or bradycardia), electrical cardioversion should be pursued as next step for acute rhythm con- trol. Therefore, in patients with hemodynamically stable AF, electrical cardioversion is favored over pharmacological cardioversion when the patient is able to tolerate sedation, desires more immediate rhythm conversion, or has failed or not met candidacy for pharmacological cardioversion. Monitoring and pre- paredness during and after electrical cardioversion include monitoring for ra re chronotropic, hemody- namic, or thromboembolic complications, and the ef- fects of anesthesia administered during electrical cardioversion. 6,13,14,20-22 3. Unsynchronized or inappropriately synchronized car- dioversion can induce VF if the shock energy is deliv- ered during the vulnerable period, the inscription of the T wave. 3,23-25 Therefore, electrical cardioversion for AF should be synchronized with the QRS complex. The synchronization feature needs to be turned on or conﬁrmed that it is on; in patients who require multi- ple shocks, the synchronization feature must be manually activated and/or con ﬁrmed before each shock attempt. Visual conﬁrmation of synchronization to QRS is important to detect inappropriate synchro- nization and ensure appropriate synchronization. 4. An earlier small, multicenter, prospective randomized study demonstrated higher efﬁcacy of initial electrical cardioversion with a biphasic waveform instead of monophasic waveform. 4 A more contemporary single- centered, randomized study of 279 patients who were randomized to synchronized direct current cardiover- sion with biphasic wavefo rm with either upfront maximum- ﬁx e de n e r g yo rs t r a t e g yo fl o w - e s c a l a t i n g energy found higher ﬁrst shock success with maximum- ﬁxed energy (75% compared with 34% for low-escalating energy group). 5 In the contemporary RAFF2 study of patients with hemodynamically stable AF of recent onset, the upfrontelectrical cardioversion g r o u pw i t hi n i t i a lb i p h a s i c2 0 0Js h o c k( a n du pt o3 consecutive shocks allowed, with higher energy permitted for subsequent shocks) had conversion to sinus rhythm in 176 of 192 (92%) patients in this upfront electrical cardioversion shock-only group. 2 5. A previous study of patients with persistent AF (me- dian AF duration, 5 months) undergoing direct current cardioversion with escalation of energy found the anterior-posterior orientation of the electrode vector more successful at restoring sinus rhythm than an anterior-lateral vector, 7 while a subsequent study of patients with recently diagnosed AF ($3h o u r sa n d<7 days) undergoing direct current cardioversion using biphasic upfront 200 J showed similar success rates with electrode vectors in either anterior-posterior or anterior-lateral orientation. 2 Taken together, when JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 189 energy output is optimized as biphasic and maximal output and the AF is of recent onset, either vector orientation may be reasonable, but for patients with longer duration of AF, the anterior-posterior orienta- tion of electrode vector may be favorable. 2 Manual pressure augmentation 26 or administration of antiar- rhythmic drugs as pretreatment (Section 8.2.3 , “Phar- macological Cardioversion ”)6,8,9 may also facilitate electrical cardioversion. 6. Increased body weight has been associated with reduced success of electrical cardioversion.27 In a small randomized clinical study, use of paddles, manual pressure augmentation (using electrically silent objects as insulator), and further escalation of electrical energy improved success of electrical cardioversion of obese patients with AF, 10 and the beneﬁts of these maneu- vers may mechanistically relate to overcoming increased transthoracic impe dance. Other alternatives in refractory cases include the use of 2 de ﬁbrillators simultaneously, effectively doubling the delivered energy. 8.2.3. Pharmacological Cardioversion Recommendations for Pharmacological Cardioversion Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 2a C-LD 1. For patients with AF, pharmacological cardioversion is reasonable as an alternative to electrical cardio- version for those who are hemodynamically stable or in situations when electrical cardioversion is preferred but cannot be performed.1 2a A 2. For patients with AF, ibutilide2,3 is reasonable for pharmacological c ardioversion for patients without depressed LV function (LVEF <40%). 2a A 3. For patients with AF, intravenous amiodarone is reasonable for pharmacological cardioversion, although time to conversion is generally longer than with other agents (8-12 hours).4-8 2a A 4. For patients with recurrent AF occurring outside the setting of a hospital, the“pill-in-the-pocket ” (PITP) approach with a single oral dose ofﬂecainide 9-11 or propafenone, 10-14 with a concomitant atrioventricular nodal blocking agent, 15 is reasonable for pharmacological cardi oversion if previously tested in a moni- tored setting. 16-18 2b B-R 5. For patients with AF, use of intravenous procainamide may be considered for pharmacological cardio- version when other intravenous agents are contraindicated or not preferred. 19 Synopsis Pharmacological cardioversion is indicated for patients w i t hn e w - o n s e to rp e r s i s t e n tA Ft h a ti sh e m o d y n a m i c a l l y stable, or in rare instances when electrical cardioversion is desired but contraindicated. Ibutilide works rapidly for pharmacological cardioversion of AF but is associated with QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, partic- ularly in patients with HFrEF. 2,32 0,21 Data support intra- venous amiodarone for pharmacological cardioversion, 4-8 although intravenous amiodarone requires a longer time for AF conversion than ibutilide. Evidence from random- ized studies support the ef ﬁcacy of ﬂecainide 9-11 and propafenone 10-14 for pharmacological cardioversion, and these drugs are reasonable for administration via the PITP approach for AF occurring outside of the hospital. 16-18 Intravenous procainamide is more effective than placebo for pharmacological conversion of AF 19 but is less effective than ibutilide. 22,23 Dofetilide, 24,25 oral amiodarone, 26-28 and oral sotalol27,28 h a v eb e e ns h o w nt ob ee f f e c t i v ef o r conversion of AF to sinus rhythm but require several days for ef ﬁcacy and therefore are not practical choices for acute pharmacological cardioversion. Data do not support intravenous sotalol for pharmacological cardioversion of AF. 29,30 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. No studies compare the ef ﬁcacy of electrical cardio- version with that of pharmacological cardioversion in patients with AF who are hemodynamically unstable. However, in a retrospective, propensity score-matched analysis of 374 hemodynamically stable patients with AF who presented to an emergency department, the incidence of successful cardioversion was higher in the direct current cardioversion group (78.2%) than in those who underwent pharmacological conversion ( 5 9 . 2 % )o rt h o s ef o rw h o ma“wait-and-watch ” approach (37.9%) was used (P<0.001). 1 Compared with the “wait-and-watch ” strategy, the ORs for conversion to sinus rhythm for direct current cardioversion and pharmacological cardioversion were 6.00 (95% CI, 3.38- Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 190 10.66) and 2.47 (1.45-4.20), respectively (P<0.001). Due to the potential greater efﬁcacy of direct current car- dioversion compared with that of pharmacological cardioversion, and due to the need for rapid successful conversion to sinus rhythm, immediate electrical car- dioversion is generally the favored option, yet some patients may not be candidates (eg, cannot undergo anesthesia), for whom pharmacological options are available. 31 2. Randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled studies have established the ef ﬁcacy of ibutilide 2,3 for con- v e r s i o no fA Ft os i n u sr h y t h m ,w i t hA Fc o n v e r s i o n rates of about 30% (compa red with 2% in placebo groups). 2,3 The efﬁcacy of ibutilide is greater for AFL (conversion rates, 38%-63%) than for AF. 2,3 Ibutilide terminates AF rapidly, with most patients converting t os i n u sr h y t h mw i t h i n3 0t o9 0m i n u t e s(Table 22 ). Ibutilide is associated with a risk of QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes.

Multiple randomized studies have found intravenous amiodarone to be effective for conversion of AF to si- nus rhythm. 4-7 A meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled studies reported relative risks of sinus rhythm associated with intravenous amiodarone at 6 to 8 hours and at 24 hours of 1.23 (P¼0.022) and 1.44 (P<0.001), respectively. 8 However, pharmacolog- ical cardioversion of AF with intravenous amiodarone requires 8 to 12 hours, compared with a much shorter response time with ibutilide (Table 22). 4. Single oral doses ofﬂecainide 9-11 and propafenone 10-14 are effective for conversion of AF to sinus rhythm, with 3- to 4-hour conversion rates of 58% to 68% for ﬂe c a i n i d e( c o m p a r e dw i t h1 8 % - 2 9 %f o rp l a c e b o )a n d 45% to 57% for propafenone (compared with 17%-29% for placebo) ( Table 22 ). A beta blocker or non- dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is generally administered at least 30 minutes before a dose of ﬂecainide or propafenone to prevent 1:1 atrioventric- ular conduction during AFL. 15 The PITP strategy was studied in 268 patients with stable AF of recent onset who presented to the emergency department. 16 Pa- tients received single-dose oral ﬂecainide or prop- afenone, and those who were successfully treated (n¼210) were discharged with a plan for the PITP approach. In the 15/C6 5-month follow-up period, single- dose ﬂecainide or propafenone was successful in 94% of episodes. However, the incidence of adverse effects is not insigniﬁcant (6%-17%). 16-18 In view of this, and because in most studies, most patients received the ﬁrst dose in the hospital before taking it as an outpa- tient, the PITP strategy should only be used for highly selected patients and after itﬁrst has been observed to be safe and effective in an inpatient setting. 17,18,34 5. Intravenous procainamide was shown to be more effective than placebo for conversion of AF to sinus rhythm (conversion rates at 1 hour, 69% versus 38%; P¼0.012) in a randomized, double-blind study of 114 FIGURE 22 Treatment Algorithm for Pharmacolog ical Conversion of AF to Sinus Rhythm *In the absence of preexcitation.†First dose administered in a facility that can provide continuous electrocardiographic monitoring and cardiac resuscitation because of the potential for proarrhythmia or postconversion bradycardia.‡IV amiodarone requires several hours for efﬁcacy; ibutilide is generally effective in 30 to 90 min but carries a higher risk of QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes. §Recommend avoidance of IV procainamide for patients initially treated with amiodarone or ibutilide to avoid excessive QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes. Rather, procainamide may be considered for patients for whom amiodarone and ibutilide are not considered optimal asﬁrst-line drugs. Colors correspond toTable 2.

In patients with previous MI and/or signiﬁcant structural heart disease, including HFrEF (LVEF £40%), ﬂecainide and propafenone 25 should not be administered due to therisk of worsening HF, potential proarrhythmia, and increased mortality. 26,27 3: Harm B-R 8. For patients with AF, dronedarone should not be administered for maintenance of sinus rhythm to those with NYHA class III and IV HF or patients who have had an episode of decompensated HF in the past 4 weeks, due to the risk of increased early mortality associated with worsening HF.28 *A LOE applies to data on dofetilide.†B-NR LOE applies to data on amiodarone. Synopsis Antiarrhythmic drugs are reasonable for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm for patients with AF who are not candidates for, or decline, catheter ablation or who prefer antiarrhythmic therapy. Flecainide 3-5 and prop- afenone 5-11 are options for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with no previous history of MI or signi ﬁcant structural heart disease. 26,27 Dronedarone is an option for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients without recent decompensated HF or severe LV dysfunction. 5,13-15 Dofe- tilide 1,5,16 and sotalol 5-7,10,17,18 are effective for maintenance of sinus rhythm but are associated with torsades de pointes and require QT interval monitoring. Sotalol is best avoided in patients with HFrEF, because most patients are already taking a beta blocker, and the addition of sotalol is unlikely to be well-tolerated. A Cochrane database meta-analysis of randomized studies 5 reported sotalol to be associated with an increase in all- cause mortality (RR, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.03-4.81]). Low-dose amiodarone is more effective than sotalol and Class IC agents for maintenance of sinus rhythm; but, in view of its adverse effects and multiple drug interactions, is best JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 193 reserved for patients for whom other antiarrhythmic drugsare ineffective, not pre ferred, or contraindicated. However, amiodarone and dofetilide are options for maintenance of sinus rhythm for patients with HFrEF, as they are effective, 1,2 and most other drugs are contraindicated. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In subanalyses of randomized trials, dofetilide 1 and amiodarone 2 have been shown to be effective for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF who have HF. Most antiarrhythmic agents, except amio- darone and dofetilide, are contraindicated in patients with HFrEF due to worsening of HF and/or increased mortality. Sotalol is best avoided in most patients with HFrEF, because most patients with HFrEFare already taking a beta blocker for mortality reduction, and the addition of a second beta blocker (sotalol) is unlikely to be well-tolerated. Therefore, although amiodarone is associated with a wide range of adverse effects and many clinically important drug interactions, amiodar- one is often used as aﬁrst-line agent for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF and HFrEF. Dofe- tilide is also an option for this indication. Patients undergoing initiation or reloading of dofetilide 29,30 should be admitted for at least 3 days to a health care facility that can provide calculations of CrCl, contin- uous electrocardiographic mo nitoring, and availability of cardiac resuscitation. 2. Randomized, controlled studies and a comprehensive Cochrane database analysis have established the ef ﬁ- cacy of ﬂecainide 3-5 and propafenone 5-11 for mainte- nance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF. In the Flec- SL (Short-term versus long-term antiarrhythmic drug treatment after cardioversion of atrial ﬁbrillation) trial, 4 ﬂecainide prevented episodes of paroxysmal AF in 31% of patients over 4 months compared with 9% in the placebo group (0.013). Sustained-release prop- afenone 425, 325, and 225 mg twice daily extended the median time to the occurrence of AF, AFL, or supra- ventricular tachycardia (S V T )c o m p a r e dw i t hp l a c e b o (>300, 291, and 112 days versus 41 days,P<0.001, for all propafenone doses versus placebo). 8 Patients with previous MI or signiﬁcant structural heart disease (scar or ﬁbrosis) should not take ﬂecainide of prop- afenone, 26,27 and individuals taking ﬂecainide or propafenone should be concomitantly taking an atrio- ventricular nodal blocking agent to reduce the risk of 1:1 AFL. 12 3. Randomized, controlled studies 13-15 and a comprehen- sive Cochrane database analysis 5 have established the efﬁcacy of dronedarone for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF. The combined analysis (n¼1,237) of EURIDIS (European Trial in Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter Patients Receiving Dronedarone for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm) and ADONIS (American-Australian-African Trial with Dronedarone in Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter Patients for the Main- tenance of Sinus Rhythm) reported longer median times to AF recurrence in dronedarone groups versus placebo (EURIDIS: 96 versus 41 days;P¼0.001; ADONIS 158 versus 59 days;P¼0.002). 14 4. Randomized, controlled studies and a comprehensive Cochrane database analysis 5 have established the efﬁ- cacy of dofetilide for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF. In the SAFIRE-D (Symptomatic Atrial Fibrillation Investigative Research on Dofetilide) study, 1,16 the probability of remaining in sinus rhythm at 1 year was higher in patients receiving dofetilide 500 mg twice daily compared with placebo (0.58 versus 0.25; P<0.001). Patients undergoing initiation or reloading of dofetilide 29,30 should be admitted for at least 3 days to a health care facility that can provide calculations of CrCl, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, and cardiac resuscitation. 5. Multiple randomized, controlled studies have estab- lished the efﬁcacy of amiodarone for maintenance of sinus rhythm in AF and have shown amiodarone to be superior to other antiarrhythmic agents. In SAFE-T (Sotalol Amiodarone Atrial Fibrillation Ef ﬁcacy Trial), amiodarone was superior to sotalol and placebo with respect to median time to recurrence of AF (487 versus 74 versus 6 days, respectively; P<0.001, for amiodar- one versus placebo and amiodarone versus sotalol). 17 In CTAF (Canadian Trial of Atrial Fibrillation), AF recurrence rates at 16 months were 35% in the amio- darone group and 63% in those randomized to com- bined propafenone or sotalol ( P<0.001). 19 However, the adverse effects pro ﬁle of amiodarone is onerous. Amiodarone is associated with a wide range of adverse effects, including pulmonary ﬁbrosis, hypo- or hyper- thyroidism, elevated trans aminases, and more rarely hepatotoxicity, p hotosensitivity, changes in skin pigmentation, peripheral neuropathy, sinus brady- c a r d i a ,Q Ti n t e r v a lp r o l ongation and torsades de pointes, corneal microdepo sits, and rarely optic neu- ropathy. 24 In addition, amiodarone is associated with many clinically relevant drug interactions.31 Therefore, amiodarone is best reserved for patients who do not respond to other recommended antiarrhythmic agents or for whom other antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated. 6. Randomized, controlled studies and a comprehensive Cochrane database analysis 5 have established the efﬁ- cacy of sotalol 6,7,10,17,18 for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF. In SAFE-T, the median time to AF recurrence was 74 days in the sotalol group, c o m p a r e dw i t h6d a y sf o rp l a c e b o(P<0.001). 16 Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 194 A Cochrane database meta-analysis of 5 randomized studies totaling 1,882 patients with AF5 reported sota- lol to be associated with an increase in all-cause mor- tality (RR, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.03-4.81]). However, this study included patients with advanced HF, and sotalol may still have a role in patients with preserved heart function. Patients undergoing initiation or reloading of oral sotalol should be admitted for at least 3 days to a health care facility that can provide calculations of CrCl, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, and cardiac resuscitation. A recent FDA-approved intrave- nous sotalol formulation can be used to evaluate the drug safety and tolerability within 6 hours and thus may reduce cost and length of stay, although the data are limited to a small sample size and very selected population. 32 7. In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled CAST (Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial), 26,27 the Vaughan Williams class IC antiarrhythmic agents ﬂe- cainide and encainide w ere associated with an increased mortality rate in patients with recent MI; most patients also had LVEF<50%.26 In the continua- tion of the study (CAST-II), the class IC agent mor- icizine also increased the mortality rate within theﬁrst 14 days of treatment. 33 In CASH (Cardiac Arrest Study Hamburg), 34 propafenone was associated with worse outcomes and increased mortality in a population of cardiac arrest survivors, mo st of whom had structural heart disease. Thus, IC agents are best avoided in pa- tients with AF who have a previous MI or signiﬁcant structural heart disease, including HFrEF, due to the risk of worsening HF and increased mortality. 8. ANDROMEDA (Antiarrhythmic Trial with Dronedarone in Moderate to Severe CHF Evaluating Morbidity Decrease) 28 was a randomized, double-blind placebo- controlled study that teste d the hypothesis that dro- nedarone would reduce the rate of hospitalization attributable to HF and possibly reduce mortality by reducing the incidence of arrhythmic death. The study enrolled patients who were hospitalized with new or worsening HF and who had at least 1 episode of NYHA class III or IV HF (shortness of breath on minimal FIGURE 23 Treatment Algorithm for Drug Therapy for Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm In each box, drugs are listed in alphabetical order.

Recommendations for Inpatient Initiation of Antiarrhythmic Agents Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1A 1. Patients with AF who are initiating, increasing the dose of, or reinitiating dofetilide therapy should be admitted for a minimum of 3 days to a facility that can provide continuous electrocardiographic moni- toring, calculations of CrCl, and cardiac resuscitation, given the potential for proarrhythmia. 1-7 2a B-R 2. In patients with AF, it is reasonable to initiate sotalol therapy in a facility that can provide continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, calculations of Cr Cl, and cardiac resuscitation, given the potential for proarrhythmia and bradycardia. 4,8-10 2a B-NR 3. In patients with AF who are initiating PITP dosing ofﬂecainide and propafe none with concomitant atrioventricular nodal blocking drugs, it is reasonable to receive theﬁrst dose in a facility that can provide continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, given the potential for proarrhythmia. 9-13 JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 197 Synopsis Pharmacological rhythm control is an alternative to catheter ablation in approp riately selected patients. However, many antiarrhythmic agents have a paradoxic risk of proarrhythmia and require close monitoring on initiation. Dofetilide and sotalol confer a relatively high risk of torsades de pointes given they prolong the QT in- terval, and this can occur early during initiation. As such, patients need to be admitted and closely monitored when starting or reinitiating dofetilide, as well as for increasing the dosage. Many practitioners choose to initiate sotalol in an inpatient setting given it can cause torsades de pointes; furthermore, unlike dofetilide, it can also cause bradyarrhythmia. Amiodarone, ﬂecainide, and prop- afenone can be started in theoutpatient setting. Because PITP with class IC (with conc omitant atrioventricular nodal blockers) can cause brady- or tachyarrhythmias, the ﬁrst attempt during an acute episode of AF may be per- formed in a monitored environment if a high dose is used. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Dofetilide, a class III antiarrhythmic drug, is a selective I Kr blocker that also blocks late Naþ current (INaL)a n d poses a high risk for torsades de pointes. The SAFIRE-D (Symptomatic Atrial Fibrillation Investigative Research on Dofetilide) study investigated dofetilide in car- dioverting and maintaini ng sinus rhythm in 325 pa- tients with AF or AFL who underwent a minimum 3- day hospitalization. 1 Of 241 patients randomized to dofetilide, 10 patients had QTc prolongation within the ﬁrst 3 days, with 2 episodes of torsades de pointes degenerating to VF. In a substudy of the AFFIRM trial, 1 of 12 patients on dofetilide experienced torsades de pointes. 3 One retrospective cohort of 378 patients found no signi ﬁcant differences in the incidence of torsades de pointes during inpatient initiation of dofetilide and sotalol (1.3% versus 1.2%). 4 One sys- tematic review found a 1% to 10% incidence of torsades de pointes in patients taking dofetilide, highest in pa- tients with HFrEF and taking higher than recom- mended (or not renally adjusted) doses. 14 In 2 randomized RCTs from the DIAMOND (Management of Hyperkalemia in Subjects Receiving Renin- angiotensin-aldosterone System Inhibitor Medications for Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction) population, in which all patients were hospitalized for at least 3 days after dofetilide was initiated, torsades de pointes occurred in 25 of 762 patients (3.3%) 5 and 7 of 749 patients (0.9%),7 respectively, with most occurring within the ﬁrst 3 days of dosing. In the DIAMOND AF substudy of these trials,6 torsades de pointes occurred in 4 dofetilide-treated patients with AF (1.6%). 2. Sotalol is a class III antiarrhythmic with beta-blocking properties. Its action potential prolongation (due to the I Kr-blocking properties of the d isomer in concert with INaL blockade) predisposes patients to torsades de pointes. One meta-analysis demonstrated that sotalol, compared with placebo or no treatment, was associated with a signiﬁcantly higher all-cause mortality rate (RR, 2.23; 1,882 patients in 5 RCTs) and proarrhythmia (RR, 3.55; 2,989 patients in 12 RCTs). 18 The SAFE-T trial randomized 665 patients to amiodarone, sotalol, or placebo, all initiated in the outpatient setting (sotalol at 80 mg twice daily for theﬁrst week and 160 mg twice daily subsequently). 15 Fifteen deaths occurred in the s o t a l o lg r o u p ,8o fw h i c hw e r es u d d e n ,w i t han o n s i g - niﬁcant mortality ratio of 1.8 compared with placebo. In 1 retrospective cohort of 120 patients undergoing sotalol initiation as an inpatient, 2 of 7 had torsades de pointes; 20 patients developed signi ﬁcant bradyar- rhythmias necessitating dose reductions, and 3 pa- tients required permanent pacing. 8 Intravenous sotalol was introduced in the UnitedStates in 2015 and reaches therapeutic levels rapidly and with easier dose titration to QTc levels and clinical response. As such, it may be an option for more expedient inpatient initiation (obviating the need for a 3-day initiation period). 16 3. The PITP strategy— ah i g hd o s eo fac l a s sI Ca g e n t(ﬂe- cainide 200-300 mg or propafenone 450-600 mg, with an atrioventricular nodal blocker) — can be considered for patients who experience infrequent episodes of symptomatic AF and do not prefer chronic antiar- rhythmic therapy. Class IC agents are generally administered with concomitantly atrioventricular nodal blocking agents to mitigate risk of rapidly con- ducting AFL. Because of the risk of adverse effects and proarrhythmia with high-dose IC agents, inpatient initiation of PITP has been studied. In 1 trial evaluating the safety of outpatient PITP therapy after initiation as an inpatient, 58 of 268 (22%) patients experienced transient hypotension, 1:1 and 2:1 AFL, and symptom- atic bradycardia. 9 In a prospective study of 43 patients who presented to the emergency department for initi- ation of PITP, 10 sinus rhythm was restored in 30 pa- tients; 13 patients remained in AF, and/or had symptomatic hypotension, converted to rapid AFL requiring cardioversion, or experienced a syncopal conversion pause. In a retrospective cohort 13 study of 273 patients initiating PITP (62% inpatient), 7 patients experienced signi ﬁcant adverse events, including syn- cope, symptomatic bradycardia/hypotension, and or- ganization to 1:1 AFL— 2 of 7 of these patients initiated PITP as an inpatient, and 2 patients required perma- nent pacemakers for bradycardia.

Antiarrhythmic Drug Follow-Up Antiarrhythmic drugs are as sociated with important adverse effects, and monitoring is recommended to assess their efﬁcacy for maintaining sinus rhythm and for pre- vention and/or early detection of adverse events. Amiodarone Recommendations for follow-up monitoring for pa- tients taking oral amiodarone are provided in Table 24. Amiodarone contains 37% iodine by weight and is there- fore associated with thyroid abnormalities in 2% to 24% of patients. 1 In 1 study, the median time to onset of amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism was 183 days, with a median onset of hyperthyroidism of 720 days. 2 Oral amiodarone may also provoke elevations in hepatic transaminases and, rarely, hepatotoxicity. 3 Amiodarone may cause pulmonary toxicity, most commonly in the form of interstitial lung disease or hy- persensitivity syndrome, 4 in 1% to 2% of patients and is fatal in approximately 10% of cases. Consequently, a chest x-ray is recommended at baseline and when there is a clinical suspicion for pulmonary toxicity. 4,5 Pulmonary function testing, including d iffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, can reveal relatively early changes in pulmo- nary function that may be attributable to amiodarone- associated pulmonary toxicity; however, the sensitivity of the test for routine screen ing of drug-induced lung toxicity in general is uncertain. 4-7 In patients who develop unexplained cough and dys- pnea while taking amiodarone, a chest CT scan can be helpful for diagnosis. 5 Corneal microdeposits (epithelial keratopathy) are common, but visual abnormalities and light sensitivity are rare. 8 Therefore, an ophthalmologic examination is reasonable only if visual abnormalities develop. Amiodarone has also been associated with neurological toxicity, particularly peripheral neuropathy. Although less common than class III antiarrhythmic agents, oral amiodarone may cause torsades de pointes9;1 analysis estimated the incidence to be 0.7%.10 Other Antiarrhythmic Drugs Recommendations for follow-up of other antiar- rhythmic agents used for management of AF are provided in Table 25. Dofetilide Dofetilide is a potent inhibitor of I Kr, augments INa-L , and is associated with torsades de pointes. 9 The inci- dence of torsades de pointes associated with dofetilide ranges from 0.9% to 3.3%. 11,12 However, the incidence c a nb es u b s t a n t i a l l yh i g h e ri ft h ed o f e t i l i d ed o s ei sn o t properly adjusted for kidney function. Patients under- going initiation or reloading of dofetilide are generally admitted for at least 3 days to a health care facility that can provide calculations of CrCl, continuous electrocar- diographic monitoring, and cardiac resuscitation. After discharge on a stable dose of these drugs, a 12-lead ECG, and levels for serum magnesium, potassium, and creat- inine are recommended every 3 to 6 months for assess- ment of QTc interval duration, electrolyte balance, and renal function, and more frequently for patients concomitantly taking other QT interval-prolonging drugs or with changing kidney func tion, to minimize the risk of drug-associated torsades de pointes. Dronedarone Rare cases of severe liver injury have been reported in association with dronedarone. These cases have occurred 4.5 to 6 months after initiation of dronedarone therapy, although 1 case of hepatotoxicity was reported as early as 2 days after initiation of dronedarone (and was ultimately TABLE 24 Recommended Monitoring for Patients Taking Oral Amiodarone Adverse Effect Baseline Testing Initial Follow-Up Testing Additional Follow-Up Testing Hypo- or hyperthyroidism TSH (T4 and T3 if TSH abnormal) 3-6 mo Every 6 mo Hepatotoxicity AST, ALT 3-6 mo Every 6 mo QT interval prolongation ECG Annually – Interstitial lung disease Chest x-ray: Recommended CT chest: Not recommended Chest x-ray: Unexplained cough or dyspnea or other signs/ symptoms suspicious for interstitial lung disease CT chest: As indicated to follow-up ongoing symptoms or chest x-rayﬁndings Corneal microdeposits (epithelial keratopathy) Not recommended Development of visual abnormalities, which may indicate optic neuropathy – Dermatologic (blue-gray skin discoloration), photosensitivity Not recommended Physical examination annually Development of skin discoloration, severe sunburn Neurological Not recommended Physical examination annually Development of peripheral neuropathy or other neurological abnormalities ALT indicates alanine transaminase; AST, aspartate transaminase; CT, computed tomography; ECG, electrocardiogram; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; and TdP, torsades de pointes.

Ibutilide is associated with nonsustained ven- tricular tachycardia (VT), QT interval prolongation, and torsades de pointes. The incidence of nonsustained VT h a sb e e nr e p o r t e dt ob ea sh i g ha s8 . 3 % . 23 Torsades de pointes occurs in approximately 2% to 7% of patients,15-22 but the incidence increases substantially in patients with depressed LVEF. 22 Most reported cases of ibutilide- associated nonsustained VT and torsades de pointes have occurred within 30 minutes after the last dose; tor- sades de pointes has rarely been reported as late as 2.5 hours after an ibutilide infusion. 22 QTc intervals generally return to baseline within 2 to 3 hours after a dose. The risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes is higher in patients with hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia. Hypokalemia has been reported to be present in 17% to 70% of patients who have developed drug-induced tor- sades de pointes. 24-27 Similarly, hypomagnesemia has been reported to be a contributing factor to numerous published cases of drug-induced torsades de pointes.27-29 Therefore, maintenance of serum potassium and magne- sium concentrations within the normal range is important before administration of ibutilide, and magnesium sup- plementation may mitigate the risk of torsades de pointes. Procainamide Intravenous procainamide is associated with hypoten- sion in 5% to 12% of patients when used for management of AF, 30,31 and BP monitoring is recommended.

Upstream Therapy Pharmacological treatments targeting upstream path- ways have included glucocorticoids, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, aldosterone antagonists, statins, omega-3 poly- unsaturated fatty acids, antioxidants, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (see Section 5, “Lifestyle and Risk Factor Modiﬁcation for AF Management”). Targeting inﬂammation, a randomized study of glucocorticoids reduced recurrent AF after ﬁrst occurrence of persistent AF, but adverse effects inhibit long-term steroid use. 1-9 Statins reduced postoperative AF in small RCTs. 10-14 However, an adequately powered placebo-controlled trial of rosuvastatin did not reduce postoperative AF.15 Statins do not prevent AF in other cardiovascular settings.16 RCTs and a meta-analysis provide limited though consistent support for the antioxidant ascorbic acid for postoperative AF. 17 Targeting ﬁbrosis, small or secondary studies of RCTs reported lower new AF with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. 2-9 However, larger RCTs targ eting AF failed to reduce recurrent AF. 18-20 RCTs showed that MRAs reduced new- onset atrial arrhythmias in patients with HFrEF along with improvement of other cardiovascular outcomes. 21,22 In patients with type 2 diabetes, HF, or CKD, sodium- glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors appear to prevent new AF.23-25 In contrast, omega-3 fatty acids do not appear to reduce AF and, in 1 large study, was associated with higher occurrence of AF. 26-31 With only limited or incon- sistent data, no recommendations are made for use of these upstream therapies for prevention of AF. 8.4. AF Catheter Ablation Recommendations for AF Catheter Ablation Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1A 1. In patients with symptomatic AF in whom antiarrhythmic drugs have been ineffective, contraindicated, not tolerated or not preferred, and continued rhythm control is desired, catheter ablation is useful to improve symptoms. 1-10 1A 2. In selected patients (generally younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF in whom rhythm control is desired, catheter ablation is useful asﬁrst-line therapy to improve symptoms and reduce progression to persistent AF. 11-16 1A 3. In patients with symptomatic or clinically signiﬁcant AFL, catheter ablation is useful for improving symptoms. 17-19 2a B-NR 4. In patients who are undergoing ablation for AF, ablation of additional clinically signiﬁcant supraven- tricular arrhythmias can be useful to reduce the likelihood of future arrhythmia.17,18,20-27 2a B-R 5.

In selected* patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic AF, catheter ablation may be useful for reducing progression of AF and its associated complications.31-39 *Younger patients with few comorbidities and a moderate to high burden of AF or persistent AF and AFL. Synopsis Catheter ablation has become an established therapy for AF because of multiple RCTs and evidence from large registries and continues to evolve as new technologies are developed. Previous professional society documents have provided different recommendations for catheter ablation dependent on whether AF was persistent or parox- ysmal. 25,40 More recent information has shown that abla- tion for AF is more effective than antiarrhythmic drugs for both persistent and paroxysmal AF and that earlier JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 201 implementation of rhythm control strategies is an important factor for improving AF ablation success rates. 4,35,41-44 As with all strategies for rhythm control of AF, impact on a patient’s goals of care and QOL should be the focus. For example, signi ﬁcantly reducing the fre- quency and duration of AF episodes but not eliminating all future episodes of AF may represent a clinically important improvement. Although RCTs have mainly used younger patients (<70 years of age) who also expe- rience the largest bene ﬁts, observational studies have reported improvement in QOL with catheter ablation in older patients. 3-6,8,45-47 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In patients who have not responded to an antiar- rhythmic drug due to a high burden of recurrent AF or adverse effects from the medication, RCTs have consistently demonstrated lower risk for recurrent symptomatic AF after ablation when compared with using another antiarrhythmic medication. 1-10 As an example, in STOP-AF, patients who had failed $1 antiarrhythmic drug (approximately 70% and 30% for 1 or 2 failed drugs, respectively) were randomized to either another antiarrhythmic drug or catheter abla- tion. At 1 year follow-up, catheter ablation was asso- ciated with a treatment success rate of 70% compared with 7% in the drug arm. 10 Similarly, in the Thermo- cool (NAVISTAR THERMOCOOL Catheter for the Radi- ofrequency Ablation of Symptomatic Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation) trial, patients with paroxysmal AF who had failed 1 antiarrhythmic medication were random- ized to catheter ablation or another antiarrhythmic drug. After 9 months, 66% of patients in the catheter ablation group were free from recurrent arrhythmia compared with 16% in the antiarrhythmic drug group. 8 Finally, most recently, in the CABANA trial, 80% of patients were on an antiarrhythmic medication and thought to be candidates for AF ablation and were randomized to catheter ablation or continued antiar- rhythmic therapy. Catheter ablation was associated with a nearly 50% reduction in recurrent AF (HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.45-0.60]; P<0.001). 4,28 2. In selected patients with paroxysmal AF, ablation is a suitable ﬁrst-line option. Several initial RCTs sug- gested a decrease in recurrent AF or AF burden with catheter ablation when compared with antiarrhythmic drugs. 16 More recent trials have shown a signi ﬁcant reduction in recurrent AF with catheter ablation compared with antiarrhythmic drugs. In a follow-up report of 1 study, after 3-year follow-up, catheter ablation continued to be associated with a signiﬁcant decrease in recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias when compared with antiarrhythmic drugs (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.38-0.67]). 14 More importantly, episodes of persistent AF developed in only 1.9% of patients randomized to catheter ablation compared with 7.4% of patients in the antiarrhythmic drug arm (HR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.13- 0.70]). 14 All of the studies that have evaluated catheter ablation as an initial strategy for rhythm control in patients with paroxysmal AF, although fairly standard exclusion criteria were used, enrolled relatively young patients (average age approximately 60 years) who had relatively few comorbidities (if present, mainly hypertension). 16 3. AFL is most commonly due to the critical isthmus formed by the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve. More rarely, in patients who have not undergone previous ablation procedures atypical AFL or focal ATs can be observed. Catheter ablation of typical AFL is effective and relatively low risk. 17-19 In an older meta- analysis of AFL ablation studies, AFL ablation was associated with an acute success rate of 90% and a complication rate of 2.6%. 18 The occurrence of AF after AFL ablation was 34%, with a recurrence rate of 23% in those patients without a history of AF compared with 53% in patients with a history of AF. By 5 years, AF developed in 60% to 70% of patients regardless of whether the patient had a history of AF before the AFL ablation. Little evidence is available in these studies for the clinical signiﬁcance of AF after AFL ablation. 4. AF can be associated with other atrial arrhythmias, particularly AFL. 20-22 During ablation for AF, ablation of previously documented or inducible sustained SVT or AFL is useful to reduce the likelihood of recurrent arrhythmias. 22-25 Although ablation alone for AF in patients with both AF and AFL will reduce the likeli- hood of AFL, and ablation targeting an inducible SVT in a patient with AF may reduce future AF, in both cases the likelihood of recurrent arrhythmias is high, although the actual recurrence rate will depend on the speci ﬁc population. 17,18,25-27 ,48,49 Conversely, prophy- lactic catheter ablation of the CTI in patients without documented or inducible AFL likely has minimal beneﬁt. 50 Alternatively, in 1 study, cryoballoon PVI as ﬁrst-line treatment for AFL is equally effective c o m p a r e dw i t hs t a n d a r dC T Ia b l a t i o nf o rp r e v e n t i n g recurrence of atrial arrhythmia and better at prevent- ing new-onset AF. 51 5. Several randomized trial s have compared catheter ablation to AADs asﬁrst-line therapy for AF.11-13 In the MANTRA-AF study, ablation and antiarrhythmic drugs as ﬁrst-line therapy for paroxysmal AF was evaluated. Although no differences in AF were identi ﬁed during the ﬁrst 18 months, at 24-month follow-up, ablation w a sa s s o c i a t e dw i t hal o w e rA Fb u r d e n( a b l a t i o n ,9 % versus antiarrhythmic drugs, 18%; P¼0.004). 11 Subse- quent studies have demonstrated similar results: In the EARLY-AF (Early Aggressive Invasive Intervention for Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 202 Atrial Fibrillation) study, at 1-year follow-up, recurrent atrial arrhythmias were identi ﬁed in 43% of the abla- tion group and 68% of the antiarrhythmic drug group (P<0.001), and in the STOP AF First (Cryoballoon Catheter Ablation in an Antiarrhythmic Drug Naive Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillat ion) study, recurrent atrial arrhythmias were identi ﬁed in 25% of the ablation group and 55% of the antiarrhythmic drug group (P<0.001). 12,13 Procedural complications were observed in 2% to 5% of patients in all 3 studies.11-13 Although AF burden was signi ﬁc a n t l yr e d u c e dw i t ha b l a t i o n compared with antiarrhythmic drug therapy in EARLY- AF, AF burden was low with either strategy (percent- age of time in AF: ablation, 0.6% versus antiarrhythmic drugs, 3.9%) and, in all 3 trials, the average age was #60 years. 11-13 Although these trials enrolled pa- tients with paroxysmal AF, recent studies have consistently found that catheter ablation is more commonly used and also effective in patients with persistent AF, particularly if of relatively recent onset (<1y e a r ) . 28 6. Catheter ablation for AF is a costly procedure yet ap- pears to provide value by improving the symptoms of AF and patient QOL. Some of the initially higher costs of the ablation procedure may be offset by reductions in subsequent cardiovascular hospitalizations. Formal economic analyses have been performed alongside 2 randomized controlled clinical trials. Both trials showed higher costs and improved QOL during follow- up, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $58,000 and V51,000 per quality adjusted life-year added, values within the intermediate value range (between $50,000 and $150,000 per quality 29,30,52-55 adjusted life-year added )b yA C C / A H Ac r i t e r i a . Models of the cost-effectiveness of catheter ablation have reported more favorable results, but their results generally depended on assumptions that ablation reduced mortality, or ischemic stroke, or both, which have not been proven. 7. In most patients, continued untreated AF will lead to progression and higher AF burden associated with worse clinical outcomes. 31-39 In patients with subclin- ical AF <24 hours, progression to overt AF or episodes >24 hours occurs at a rate of 8.8% per year, and those patients who develop AF are more likely to be hospi- talized for HF. 56 Several observational studies have reported AF progression may be improved by using a catheter-based ablation rhythm-control strat- egy. 33-35 ,37,38 As an example, in 1 randomized trial that was stopped prematurely, in 255 patients with parox- ysmal AF randomized to catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic medication, freedom from persistent AF or AT was signiﬁcantly higher with catheter abla- tion (ablation: 2.4%, versu s antiarrhythmic medica- t i o n ,1 7 . 5 % ,1 - s i d e dP¼0.0009). 57 However, serious adverse events associated with the ablation were observed in 8% of patients. 57 Despite the potential risks associated with catheter ablation, in a recent analysis of a large registry that speci ﬁcally evaluated asymptomatic patients, rhythm control was associated with an improvement in the composite outcome of cardiac death, ischemic stroke, and hospitalization for HF. 58 The impact was largest in those patients who underwe nt catheter ablation for rhythm control, particularly in those with paroxysmal AF, LA diameters #50 mm, 58 or higher stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score $3). In a post hoc analysis of EAST-AFNET 4, the magnitude of bene ﬁtf r o ma rhythm-control strategy for reducing the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, stroke, or hospitalizations for HF or ACS was independent of symptom status, and cathet er ablation for rhythm control was used in approximately 20% of patients, whether symptomatic or not. 59 8.4.1. Patient Selection Patient selection is theﬁrst step and a critically important step in deciding candidacy for catheter ablation. 1-4 Younger patients are likely to derive greater long-term beneﬁt, including delaying AF progression. However, clinical trials have demonstrated improved cardiovascular outcomes with rhythm control, even with median ages in the 70s. 5 Patients with minimal atrial enlargement have the best outcomes, 6 whereas increased myocardial ﬁbrosis 7,8 and more persistent forms of AF are associated with higher rates of recurrencea f t e ra b l a t i o n .T i m ef r o m diagnosis to ablation is also associated with improved outcomes after ablation. 9,10 Although the likelihood of recurrence of AF is 1 factor that should be considered, it is difﬁcult to predict, 11 and certain patients may derive even greater beneﬁts from catheter ablation, such as in patients with HFrEF, who have been shown to have improved functional status, LV functi on, and cardiovascular out- comes. 12-14 In some patients, ablation should be avoided as it is unlikely to be successful due to overwhelming substrate or ongoing physiologic processes that either strongly perpetuate the risk of AF or make maintenance of sinus rhythm unlikely. These situa tions include but are not limited to advanced in ﬁltrative cardiomyopathies like amyloid, severe mitral stenosis or regurgitation, and cor pulmonale.

Techniques and Technologies for AF Catheter Ablation Recommendations for Techniques and T echnologies for AF Catheter Ablation Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1A 1. In patients undergoing ablation for AF, PVI is recommended as the primary lesion set for all patients unless a different speciﬁc trigger is identiﬁed.1-7 2b B-R 2. In patients undergoing ablation for AF, the value ofother endpoints beyond PVI such as noninducibility and ablation of additional anatomic ablation targets (eg, posterior wall sites, low voltage areas, complex fractionated electrograms, rotors) is uncertain. 8-18 Synopsis Catheter ablation is now established as an effective option for rhythm control in patients with AF and AFL.1-7,16 However, in patients with AF, additional abla- tion targets beyond isolation of PVI as a routine strategy have not reduced AF recurrence or burden in RCTs. 8-18 Although achieving durable pulmonary vein ablation in patients with AF has been associated with less recurrent arrhythmias, other endpoints, such as termination of F and noninducibility, have not been associated with improved outcomes. 19-28 Signi ﬁcant complications of AF ablation include stroke and TIAs, pericardial effusion, and vascular complications. 16 The most serious complication that occurs after the ablation procedure is development of an esophageal atrial ﬁstula, although other complications, such as PV stenosis can occur. 8-18 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Multiple randomized studies have shown that PVI is more effective than medical therapy for reducing AF burden. 1-7 A recent meta-analysis of 6 RCTs found that strategies that included PVI were associated with a 50% reduction in the development of recurrent AF when compared with strategies that did not include PVI.7 2. Studies have evaluated the use of different endpoints immediately after catheter ablation for predicting durable PVI and the likelihood of future arrhythmias with mixed results.19-28 In the largest randomized study to date, techniques such as waiting for 30 minutes, using adenosine triphosphate to facilitate PV reconnection, or the combination of waiting and using adenosine were not superior to no testing for predicting durable pul- monary vein isolation or red uction in future arrhyth- mias. Although noninducibility remains important in determining whether ablation for paroxysmal SVT has been successful, noninducibility after AF ablation or termination of AF with ablation have had mixed results for predicting the likelihood of future recurrence. 19-29 Multiple ablation targets beyond PVI have been evalu- ated in randomized controlled and observational trials, including the LAA, posterior wall, the ligament of Marshall, or atrial scar. 8-18 Results have been mixed, and no strategy has emerged that is broadly applicable in all patients, likely because the individual mechanisms for AF vary from patient to patient. 8-18 Targeting large areas of atrial tissue may have potential negative consequences, including a higher likelihood of complications such as atrioesophageal ﬁstula, poor LA mechanics, atypicalﬂut- ters, and increased risk for stroke. 30-35 8.4.3. Management of Recurrent AF After Catheter Ablation Recommendations for Management of Re current AF After Catheter Ablation Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. In patients with recurrent symptomatic AF after catheter ablation, repeat catheter ablation or antiar- rhythmic drug therapy is useful to improve symptoms and freedom from AF.1-11 2a A 2. In some patients who have undergone catheter ablation of AF, short-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy after ablation can be useful to reduce early recurrences of atrial arrhythmia and hospitalization. 12-16 Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 204 Synopsis Recurrences of AF are common after a ﬁrst ablation procedure, occurring in 30% to 40% of patients in contemporary clinical trials. 1,2 In general US practice, 11% of patients undergoing de novo ablation have a repeat ablation by 1 year.3 Patients often experience improved symptoms and QOL even when they experience recur- rence after catheter ablation. 4 Nonetheless, recurrent atrial arrhythmia that leads to symptoms or LV dysfunc- tion requires treatment. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In general, successful suppression of AF improves with additional or multiple ablation procedures. 5-7 The ab- solute limit to the number of ablations a patient can undergo is unknown. For example, it is possible that a p a t i e n tw i t hp r e v i o u sP V Ia n dr e p e a ta b l a t i o n sw i t h substrate modiﬁcation may beneﬁtf r o ma b l a t i o no fP V to LA reconnections, or ablation of additional triggers. However, repeat ablations carry increased risks of a d v e r s ee f f e c t s .T h e s er i s k sa r er a r eb u ti n c l u d eP V stenosis and stiff LA syndrome. 8,9,17 Many of the randomized clinical trials, which have demonstrated superiority of catheter ablation over anti- arrhythmic drug therapy, included repeat ablation pro- cedures as part of their prospective study designs. 1,10,11,18 Randomized data also suggest that repeat ablation is su- perior to antiarrhythmic drug therapy for the treatment of recurrent AF afterﬁrst ablation. 19 Although no large direct head-to-head trials are available of repeat catheter abla- tion versus no repeat catheter ablation, the aggregate data from randomized trials suggest that repeat ablation im- proves arrhythmia suppression and symptom control. Limited numbers of randomized trials can guide the optimal approach to repeat catheter ablation (beyond reisolation of the PVs). 12,13 Although randomized data suggest that repeat ablation is superior to antiarrhythmic drug therapy for the treatment of recurrent AF afterﬁrst ablation,19 recurrences of AF after catheter ablation can also be successfully treated with antiarrhythmic drug therapy even when these same medications may have been ineffective before ablation. 3,14 Antiarrhythmic drugs have also been associ- ated with decreased recurrent atrial arrhythmias in those who have undergone previous ablation.14 Other studies have shown that use of previously ineffective antiar- rhythmic therapy can be effective after ablation. 15 Optimal rhythm control often requires a combined approach of catheter ablation and adjunctive antiarrhythmic drug therapy, especially in patients with long-standing persis- tent AF or patients with advanced atrial myopathies. 2. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the ef ﬁcacy and safety of short-term (3-6 months postablation) antiarrhythmic therapy to prevent recurrences of AF, symptoms, cardioversion, and hospitalization after ablation. 16,20,21 Moreover, continued use of antiar- rhythmic drugs beyond the blanking period (3 months) may reduce the risk of recurrent atrial arrhythmias out to 1 year. 15 Meta-analysis of randomized trials evalu- ating the use of short-term antiarrhythmic drug ther- apy have determined that it signiﬁcantly decreases the risk of early, but not late, recurrence.22,23 Observational data from nationwide practice data also suggest that antiarrhythmic therapy aft er ablation can reduce hos- pital readmissions by 37% in the short term (90 days) after ablation. 24 A l t h o u g ht h ee v i d e n c eb a s ef o rs h o r t - term antiarrhythmic drug therapy after ablation is robust, the decision to use short-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy should be based on the patient’sr i s ka n d informed by SDM. 8.4.4. Anticoagulation Therapy Before and After Catheter Ablation Recommendations for Anticoagulation Therapy Before and After Catheter Ablation Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. In patients on warfarin who are undergoing catheter ablation of AF, catheter ablation should be per- formed on uninterrupted therapeutic anti coagulation with a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0.1 1A 2. In patients on a DOAC who are undergoing catheter ablation of AF, catheter ablation should be performed with either continuous or minimally interrupted oral anticoagulation. 2-10 1 B-NR 3. In patients who have undergone catheter ablation ofAF, oral anticoagulation should be continued for at least 3 months after the procedure with a longer duration determined by underlying risk.11 1 B-NR 4. In patients who have undergone catheter ablation ofAF, continuation of longer-term oral anticoagulation should be dictated according to the patients’ stroke risk (eg, CHA2DS2-VASc score ‡2).11-17 JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 205 Synopsis Catheter ablation has been demonstrated in random- ized clinical trials to reduce arrhythmia burden improve QOL and, in select populations, it has been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes. Complications after catheter ablation are infre quent, yet the risk of throm- boembolic events is increased after ablation. The risk of stroke in the ﬁrst 30 days after ablation is 0.8%. 18 Thus, oral anticoagulation before, during, and after catheter ablation procedures is paramount. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. All patients undergoing catheter ablation require intraprocedural intravenous anticoagulation with heparin or direct thrombin inhibitors in those with heparin allergies. Management of oral anticoagulation during these procedures is also critically important. In those patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF who are taking warfarin for their oral anticoagulation, evi- dence from observational studies and randomized trial data suggest that optimal ef ﬁcacy and safety is ach- ieved with uninterrupted warfarin. Patients undergo- ing catheter ablation of AF who have subtherapeutic INRs or interrupted warfarin have more evidence of silent cerebral ischemic events on brain magnetic resonance imaging after the procedure. 1 In the COMPARE (Role of Coumadin in Preventing Thrombo- embolism in Atrial Fibrillation [AF] Patients Undergo- ing Catheter Ablation) tria l, interruption of warfarin was highly associated with periprocedural thrombo- embolic events (OR, 13 [95% CI, 3.1-55.6]; P<0.001). 1 Patients treated with uninterrupted warfarin had lower rates of thromboembolic events (5% versus 0.25%; P<0.001) and lower rates of periprocedural bleeding compared with those in whom warfarin was stopped or interrupted. 2. Although uninterrupted warfarin is superior to inter- rupted warfarin among persons undergoing catheter ablation of AF, meta-analyses have demonstrated lower risks of major bleeding with uninterrupted direct oral anticoagulation compared with uninterrupted vitamin K antagonism. 2 Many randomized trials have been completed that compare uninterrupted DOACs versus uninterrupted VKAs, including trials of apix- aban, 3,4 dabigatran, 5 edoxaban, 6 and rivaroxaban. 7 In aggregate, these trials have demonstrated the non- inferiority of uninterrupted direct-acting oral anti- coagulation compared wit h uninterrupted vitamin K antagonism. Several randomized trials also compare minimally interrupted direct-acting oral anti- coagulation versus uninte rrupted direct-acting oral anticoagulation 8 or uninterrupted vitamin K antago- nism. 9 These clinical trials and meta-analyses suggest that outcomes with minimally interrupted direct- acting oral anticoagulation are not different compared with continuous anticoagulation. 10 3. The risk of thromboembolic and stroke events in- creases after ablation due to vascular and cardiac instrumentation, release o f tissue factor, and myocar- dial injury. Most randomized clinical trials of catheter ablation that demonstrate a low risk of periprocedural stroke mandated oral anticoagulation for a minimum of 2 months after ablation to reduce the risk of stroke, regardless of CHA 2DS2-VASc score.19 4. Greater burden or time in AF is associated with higher rates of stroke.12-14 Accordingly, reducing exposure to AF via catheter ablation might be expected to reduce the risk of stroke. Although some observational studies have identiﬁed lower stroke risk after catheter ablation, 15,16 randomized clinical trials of catheter ablation have not demonstrated reductions in stroke. 11,17 Observational data regarding the risk of s t r o k ea f t e rc a t h e t e ra b l a t i o no fA Fa r em i x e da n d vary across study design and methods. For example, in an analysis of 4,050 patients undergoing catheter ablation with a CHA 2DS2-VASc score $2i nD e n m a r k , the risk after ablation was low and comparable in those who did (0.93/100 patient years) and did not (0.97/100 patient years) discontinue anticoagulation >3 months after ablation. 20 In contrast, a study of 6,866 patients who underwent catheter ablation of AF in US clinical practice found that the risk of stroke was increased in patients with a CHA 2DS2-VASc score $2 who discontinued oral anticoagulation after 3 months (HR, 2.48 [95% CI, 1.11-5.52]; P<0.05). 21 In this same study, no increased risk was observed that was associated with discontinuation after 3 months in those with a CHA 2DS2-VASc score of 0 to 1. Ongoing randomized trials are investigating whether oral anticoagulation can be safely discontinued in patients who have no signiﬁcant arrhythmia recurrences after catheter ablation. Finally, the OPTION (Comparison of Anticoagulation With Left Atrial Appendage Closure After AF Ablation) trial (NCT03795298) will test whether LAAO is noninferior to continued oral anti- coagulation after cath eter ablation of AF. 22 Given (1) the absence of randomized data that directly address this question, (2) the absence of consistent data demonstrating a lower risk of stroke after ablation, and (3) increased rates of stroke among persons with a CHA 2DS2-VASc score $2 who discontinue oral anti- coagulation after 3 months, persons who have un- dergone catheter ablation AF should continue guideline-directed oral anticoagulation beyond 3 months based on their stroke risk, such as those with moderate-high risk of stroke.

Complications After AF Catheter Ablation Complications of AF catheter ablation occur in approxi- mately 5% of patients, with most being vascular (Table 26) 1-4 However, several life-threatening complica- tions may occur. Complications are more common with annual operator procedures <25 patients and hospital procedures <50 patients. 1 Some studies demonstrate a higher incidence of complications in women, 1 but the CABANA RCT did not.5 The most severe complication is an LA to esophageal ﬁstula, which is often fatal but quite rare. Another life-threatening complication is pericardial tamponade, but this can usually be treated with prompt pericardiocentesis. Clinically signi ﬁcant strokes and TIAs are observed in <1% of patients. 1-4 Deaths during ablations are typically from tamponade but may occur with strokes.1-4 Phrenic and vagal nerve paralysis are seen with cryoa- b l a t i o nb u ta r el e s sc o m m o ni nr a d i o f r e q u e n c ya b l a t i o n .2 Early reports of PV stenosis were largely due to ablation inside the veins; with antral ablation this is rarely seen. The most common complications include bruising and bleeding at the vascular access site. Less common vascular compli- cations include damage to the arterial or venous system or an atrioventricular ﬁstula requiring surgery. 8.5.

Several randomized and nonrandomized studies have shown that in patients who require cardiac-implanted electronic devices for sinus node dysfunction who have intact atrioventricul ar conduction, devices that maintain atrioventricular synchrony reduce the inci- dence and progression of AF. 1-6 Although maintenance of atrioventricular synchrony is important, post hoc analysis of MOST and a meta-analysis have demon- strated that the amount of ventricular pacing is an important contributor to the development of AF. 6,20 Algorithms designed speci ﬁcally to reduce ventricular pacing reduced the incidence of AF in individual studies, but meta-analyses of RCTs suggests that the beneﬁt may extend only to those patients with very infrequent pacing ( <10%). 19,21-23 In the only random- ized study that solely evalu ated patients with atrio- ventricular block (and >70 years of age) who required permanent pacing, dual-chamber pacing did not reduce the incidence of AF when compared with single-chamber ventricular pacing. 24 2. Several studies have repo rted that specialized anti- tachycardia pacing algorithms can terminate atrial tachyarrhythmias but have not reduced AF burden. 7-9 However, in a post hoc analysis of a subset of pa- tients who had high success rate of antitachycardia pacing ( $60%), antitachycardia pacing algorithms reduced the overall AF/AT burden from 2.5 hours/day to 0.68 hours/day ( P<0.01). 10 Am o r er e c e n ts t u d y (MINERVA [Minimize Right Ve ntricular Pacing to Pre- vent Atrial Fibrillation and Heart Failure]) found a modestly effective pacing algorithm that monitors for periods of regularization of atrial activity to initiate pacing algorithms reduced p rogression to persistent AF. 11,12 This algorithm may be more effective in pa- tients who have undergone previous AF ablation.13 3. Early nonrandomized evidence suggests that His bundle and left bundle pacing may reduce AF inci- dence and progression when compared with RV pacing in patients with high burden ventricular pacing. 14,15 In 1 study, left bundle branch area pacing reduced the incidence of new AF when compared with RV pacing, but this beneﬁt was only evident in those patients with ventricular pacing >20%.14 However, a meta-analysis that has evaluated all published evidence has only demonstrated a trend toward reduced AF. In 1 study, His bundle pacing reduced the likelihood of develop- ment of persistent AF in patients with sinus node dysfunction and a PR interval >180 ms. 25 There is in- direct evidence for the potential bene ﬁto ft h ev e n - tricular depolarization pattern for reducing AF because an algorithm that automatically adjusts pacing pa- rameters based on intri nsic conduction has been associated with a decrease in longer AF episodes (>48 h o u r s )w h e nc o m p a r e dw i t hc o n v e n t i o n a lp r o g r a m - ming in a retrospective analysis. 26-28 4.

Surgical Ablation Recommendations for Surgical Ablation Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 2a B-R 1. For patients with AF who are undergoing cardiac surgery, concomitant surgical ablation can be beneﬁcial to reduce the risk of recurrent AF.1-3 2a B-NR 2. In patients undergoing surgical ablation, anticoagulation therapy is reasonable for at least 3 months after the procedure to reduce the risk of stroke or systemic embolism.2-4 2b B-R 3. For patients with symptomatic, persistent AF refractory to antiarrhythmic drug therapy, a hybrid epicardial and endocardial ablation might be reasonable to reduce the risk of recurrent atrial arrhythmia.5-7 Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 208 Synopsis A m o n gp a t i e n t sw i t hA Fo rA F L ,c o n c o m i t a n ts u r g i c a l ablation at the time of cardiac surgery has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent atrial arrhythmia. However, it is associated with an increased risk of renal dysfunction and pacemaker placement. Among patients with symp- tomatic, persistent AF, a hybrid procedure combining epicardial and endocardial ablation has been shown to reduce the burden of atrial arrhythmia. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1 .T h eo r i g i n a la t r i a lm a z eprocedure consisted of a bia- trial lesion set derived from a“cut-and-sew ” technical approach. 8 Similar lesion sets delivered by cryoenergy or radiofrequency were subsequently developed. Sur- gical ablation concomitant with cardiac surgery currently takes place in approximately 1 in 5 patients with previous AF, most commonly at the time of a mitral valve procedure but also during aortic and tricuspid procedures or CABG. 9 In a Cochrane review of 22 clinical trials conducted between 1998 and 2013, there was evidence that surgical ablation is associated w i t hi n c r e a s e df r e e d o mf r o mA F ,A F L ,o rA T( R R ,2 . 0 4 [95% CI, 1.63-2.55]). However, risk of pacemaker placement was increased (RR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.12- 2.54]). 1,2 A subsequent trial of patients undergoing mitral valve surgery with AF similarly found that ablation leads to increased freedom from AF at 1 year (63.2% versus 29.4%; P<0.001) but with increased risk of pacemaker placement (21.5 versus 8.1 per 100 patient-years; P¼0.01). 3 Observational data suggest surgical ablation is associated with increased survival as well as risk of pacemaker placement and renal dysfunction. 10-14 2. Two components of Virchow’st r i a d— endothelial injury and stasis of bloodﬂow— can lead to a prothrombogenic milieu in the context of surgical ablation. The former is a consequence of suture lines or ablation lesions, whether they result from radiofrequency or cry- oenergy. The latter can occur with postcardioversion atrial stunning and/or atri al manipulation and conse- quent loss of mechanical function. Accordingly, trial protocols for several key studies of surgical ablation include the use of oral anticoagulation for at least 3 months after intervention. 2,3 Nonrandomized data s u g g e s tt h a ts t r o k eo rs y s t e m i ce m b o l i s mi nt h eﬁrst 3 months after catheter ablation is uncommon, but the risk increases with discontinuation of oral anti- coagulation, especially in high-risk patients. 4 Patients who undergo surgical ablation may be at similar risk, a n dt h u so r a la n t i c o a g u l a t i o n ,w h e t h e ri tb ew i t h warfarin or a DOAC 15 b e c a u s ea p p r o p r i a t ea c c o u n t i n g for concomitant indications such as a mechanical heart valve or mitral stenosis, should be initiated regardless of stroke risk when adequate surgical hemostasis has been achieved. 3. In a randomized trial of 149 patients with symptomatic and refractory AF, compared with catheter ablation, a hybrid procedure consisting of closed-chest, epicardial ablation combined with and followed by endocardial ablation led to increased fr eedom atrial a rrhythmias, including AF, AFL, and AT at 12 months (67.7% versus 50.0%; P¼0.036) at the expense of an increased risk of major adverse events such as stroke, bleeding, or pericardial effusion (0.0% versus 7.8%; P¼0.0525). 16 The ablation set of the hybrid procedure focused on surgical ablation of the LA posterior wall and PVI, while endocardial ablation co mpleted PVI and addressed remaining gaps. Other observational studies of hybrid procedures with limited sizes show comparable rates of AF-free survival and safety. 5-7 9. MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH HF 9.1. General Considerations for AF and HF AF and HF frequently coexist, and either can predispose to the development of the other. Shared risk factors (eg, age, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and hypertension) may contribute, as may atrial remodeling and diastolic dysfunction. 1-3 The prevalence of AF is higher in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction c o m p a r e dw i t hH F r E F . 4 In a recent study of the Fra- mingham cohort, among individuals with new AF, more than one-third (37%) had HF. 5 Conversely, among in- dividuals with new HF, more than half (57%) had AF. A meta-analysis, including 53,969 patients from 9 observa- tional and 7 randomized trials, concluded that after adjusting for confounding factors, AF was associated with an increased total mortality, irrespective of LV systolic dysfunction, with an OR of 1.40 (95% CI, 1.32-1.48) in randomized trials and an OR of 1.14 (95% CI, 1.03-1.26) in observational studies. 6 The risk of mortality is higher when AF is incident after a diagnosis of HF as compared with prevalent AF, and in patients with HFrEF compared with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. 4,7-9 Special considerations for the management of patients w i t hH Fa n dA Fa r ed i s c u s s e di nt h en e x ts e c t i o no n management of AF in HF, as well as in Section 7.2 (“Speci ﬁc Pharmacological Agents for Rate Control ”) and Section 8.2 (“Electrical and Pharmacological Cardioversion ”).

Management of AF in Patients With HF Recommendations for Management of AF in Patients With HF* Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. In patients who present with a new diagnosis of HFrEF and AF, arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy should be suspected, and an early and aggressive approach to AF rhythm control is recommended.1,2 1A 2. In appropriate patients with AF and HFrEF who are on GDMT, and with reasonable expectation of pro- cedural beneﬁt( Figure 24), catheter ablation is beneﬁcial to improve symptoms, QOL, ventricular function, and cardiovascular outcomes. 3-13 2a B-NR 3. In appropriate patients with symptomatic AFand HFpEF with reasonable expectation of beneﬁt, catheter ablation can be useful to improve symptoms and improve QOL.14,15 2a B-R 4. In patients with AF and HF, digoxin is reasonable for rate control, in combination with other rate- controlling agents or as monotherapy if other agents are not tolerated.16,17 2a B-NR 5. In patients with AF and HF with rapid ventricular rates in whom beta blockers or calcium channel blockers are contraindicated or ineffective, intravenous a miodarone is reasonable for acute rate control.†18,19 2a B-R 6. In patients with AF, HFrEF (LVEF<50%), and refractory rapid ventricular response who are not candi- dates for or in whom rhythm control has failed, AVNA and biventricular pacing therapy can be useful to improve symptoms, QOL, and EF.20-23 2a B-NR 7. In patients with AF, HF, and implanted biventricular pacing therapy in whom an effective pacing per- centage cannot be achieved with pharmacological therapy, AVNA can be beneﬁcial to improve functional class, 24,25 reduce the risk of ICD shock,26 and improve survival. 24,25 2a B-NR 8. In patients with AF-induced cardiomyopathy who have recovered LV function, long-term surveillance can be beneﬁcial to detect recurrent AF in view of the high risk of recurrence of arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy. 27,28 2b B-NR 9. In patients with suspected AF-induced cardiomyopathy or refractory HF symptoms undergoing phar- macological rate-control therapy for AF, a stricter rate-control strategy (target heart rate <80 bpm at rest and <110 bpm during moderate exercise) may be reasonable.29-31 2b C-LD 10. In patients with AF and HFrEF who undergo AVNA,conduction system pacing of the His bundle or left bundle branch area may be reasonable as an alternative to biventricular pacing to improve symptoms, QOL, and LV function. 32-35 3: Harm B-R 11. In patients with AF and known LVEF<40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel –blocking drugs should not be administered because of their potential to exacerbate HF.36 3: Harm B-R 12. For patients with AF, dronedarone should not be administered for maintenance of sinus rhythm to those with NYHA class III and IV HF or patients who have had an episode of decompensated HF in the past 4 weeks, due to the risk of increased early mortality associated with worsening HF. 37 *Please see other recommendations on anticoagulation in AF (Section 8.4.4, “Anticoagulation Therapy Before and After Catheter Ablation”), rate control in HF (Section 7, “Rate Control”), and agents for pharmacological cardioversion (Section 7.2, “Speciﬁc Pharmacological Agents for Rate Control”) and maintenance of sinus rhythm (Section 8.3.1, “Speciﬁc Drug Therapy for Long-Term Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm”). †Consider the risk of cardioversion and stroke when using amiodarone as a rate-control agent. Synopsis AF is the most common cause of arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy, 27,38 a condition where persistent AF, with or without rapid ventricular rates, can lead to LV dysfunction and HF that can be partially or completely reversed with adequate arrhythmia control. 39 AF can either be the only reason f or cardiomyopathy (AF- induced) or can exacerbate LV dysfunction and HF in a patient with concomitant structural heart disease (AF- mediated). 38,39 Medical therapies for rate control (Section 7) or rhythm control (Section 8)o fA Fh a v es p e - cial considerations in patients with HF based on differ- ential safety.

Although earlier trials were small and focused on end- points such as improvement in LVEF, QOL, and 6-minute walk, 2 of the largest trials have shown a bene ﬁti n reducing mortality rate and HF hospitalization. 3-13 Pa- tients with AF and HF may undergo AVNA for rate control refractory to medical therapy. 20,21 Similar to ﬁndings in patients who undergo pacemaker implantation for con- duction system disease, patients with HF appear to be more likely to develop or have worsened cardiomyopathy related to RV pacing dyssynchrony 41,42 and have improved outcomes with biventricular or conduction system pacing. 23,32,33,35 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. It can be dif ﬁcult to determine the extent of the contribution of AF to cardiomyopathy and new onset HFrEF. Allowing AF to persist long term, regardless of reasonable rate control, may result in worsening HF and cardiomyopathy. An early and aggressive approach to rhythm control can reduce AF burden, resulting in favorable ventricular remodeling and halting of any occult arrhythmia-induced cardiomy- opathy. In a prespeci ﬁed subanalysis of 798 HF pa- tients (NYHA class II/III or LVEF <50%) in EAST- AFNET (HFpEF, 442; midrange, 211; HFrEF [ <40%], 132), early rhythm control signiﬁcantly improved the composite outcome of death, stroke, or hospitaliza- tion for worsening of HF or for ACS (early rhythm control, 94/396; 5.7/100 pa tient-years) versus usual care (130/402; 7.9/100 patient-years; HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.56-0.97]; P¼0.03), and this was not altered by HF status. Safety outcomes in each group were compa- rable. However, only 17% of the HF population had LVEF <40%. 1 In a post hoc analysis of the CASTLE-AF trial, an AF burden <50% at 6 months postcatheter ablation was associated with signiﬁcant improvement in the mortality rate and HF hospitalization in pa- tients with AF and HFrEF. 2 2. Multiple RCTs in HFrEF have shown that in patients with symptoms due to AF, ablation improves symp- toms and QOL compared with a rate control or an antiarrhythmic drug strategy. 3-13 In each of 3 meta- analyses, QOL was improved. 3,10,13 Although in the past a trial of antiarrhythmic drugs was advised before pursuing catheter ablati on, current data support ablation for AF as ﬁrst-line therapy even before antiarrhythmic drugs; often patients require both. Data on LVEF, hospitalizations, and mortality rates are less robust, but nearly every larger RCT does show some bene ﬁt in these outcomes ( Table 27 ). Charac- teristics that may identify patients with a higher likelihood of success or failure with AF catheter ablation are listed in Figure 24. 43 3 .D a t af o rA Fc a t h e t e ra b l a t i o na r ef a rl e s sr o b u s tf o r HFpEF. The largest analysis for this group of patients was a subanalysis of the CABANA trial of patients with HF; in this subgroup analysis, 778 patients (35% of the study population) enrolled in the study who had NYHA class II HF experienced improvement in sur- vival, freedom from AF recurrence, and improved QOL compared with the medical therapy group. 14 Most of these had HFpEF. In this subanalysis, cath- eter ablation was associated with a reduction in the mortality rate and HF. A meta-analysis on catheter ablation in patients with HFpEF that included 7 studies and 764 patients showed the ablation to be safe and effective and associated with lower hospi- talizations and the mortality rate. 15 4. A small RCT in patients with persistent AF and HF (most HFrEF) compared the effects of digoxin, car- vedilol, and the combination. 16 Combination therapy was associated with better rate control and symptom relief than monotherapy. The RATE-AF trial random- ized 160 patients ($60 years of age) with persistent AF a n dH F( 8 1 %w i t hL V E F$50%) to digoxin or biso- prolol. 17 No signi ﬁcant difference was noted in the primary endpoint of QOL at 6 months. Secondary outcomes, including natriuretic peptide levels, were signi ﬁcantly lower in the digoxin group, without a signi ﬁcant difference in resting heart rate at 12 months. Adverse effects were less common in the digoxin group. Observational and post hoc analyses have suggested an excess mortality with digoxin in patients with AF; however, residual confounding due to the use of digoxin in sicker patients may have a role. 44 In patients with HF on digoxin chronically, post hoc analyses have suggested increased mortality rates and hospitalization with serum digoxin levels$1 ng/mL; levels <0.8 ng/mL in HF were associated with the lowest mortality rate, although the study was for therapy of HF and not AF. 45 In the DAAF (Digitalis in Acute Atrial Fibrillation) trial of 239 patients (12% with HF), intravenous digoxin led to a signiﬁcant decrease i nh e a r tr a t ea t2h o u r sc o m p a r e dw i t hp l a c e b o . 5. In trials of critically ill patients, some of which included a smaller proportion of patients with HF, intravenous amiodarone has been shown to be effec- tive in controlling ventricular rates. 18,19,46 In a JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 211 TABLE 27 Randomized Trials of Rhythm Control in HF Study/ Author (y) No. Pts.

How- ever, intravenous diltiazem was associated with a signi ﬁcantly higher frequency of hypotension requiring discontinuation. 19 In another retrospective study of 38 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (9 with HF), intravenous amiodarone was asso- ciated with a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in ven- tricular rate without decrease in BP (and in some cases improved hemodynamics) compared with intrave- nous diltiazem and digoxin. 18 Intravenous beta blockers may also cause hypotension and may not be tolerated in patients with HF and hemodynamic instability. Although less frequent, intravenous amiodarone can also be associated with hypotension, speci ﬁcally with the intravenous bolus. The possibil- ity of conversion to sinus rhythm with intravenous amiodarone and associated potential for thromboem- bolism, especially in patients with longer-standing AF not on anticoagulation, should factor into the risk- beneﬁt decision when intravenous amiodarone is chosen for rate control. 6. Small RCTs of patients with medically refractory AF and HF show that patients who undergo AVNA and conventional pacemaker implantation are less symp- tomatic and have improvements in QOL and exercise tolerance compared with subjects who are managed with medical rate control. 20-22 ,47 A meta-analysis comparing outcomes with AVNA or medications showed, in 2 studies analyzing patients with reduced E F ,am o d e s t ,y e ts i g n iﬁcant þ4% increase in EF in patients undergoing AVNA and RV pacing, while pa- tients with normal EF at baseline did not show a sig- niﬁcant change. 48 A meta-analysis of 93 studies including 11,343 patients who underwent AVNA with either RV pacing or biventricular pacing showed per- iprocedural complications of arrhythmia, HF, and lead dislodgement in 2% to 2.5%, 49 few long-term data, and worse outcomes in younger patients with reduced EF and RV pacing. 49 Overall, these data showed improved mortality in patients with HF who are treated with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), at the risk of increased device-related complica- tions. 49 The APAF-CRT (Ablate and Pace in Atrial Fibrillation plus Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) mortality trial of 133 subjects with AF, HF, and narrow QRS was stopped early due to a HR of 0.26 for all- cause mortality, also suggesting that when AVNA is performed in patients with HF, CRT is preferable to conventional RV pacing. 23 Data are accumulating regarding similarly improved outcomes with conduc- tion system pacing compared with conventional RV pacing in this population. 32-35 7. Conduction of AF may hinder delivery of biven- tricular pacing therapy (CRT) and worsen out- comes. 25 Initial clinical trials of CRT included low numbers of patients with AF, 50 and observational analyses suggested a reduced bene ﬁto fC R Ti np a - tients with AF due to ineffective biventricular pac- ing. 51,52 A systematic review to evaluate the impact of AVNA in patients with AF and CRT found AVNA was associated with signi ﬁcant reductions in all- cause mortality (RR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.26-0.68]), car- diovascular mortality (RR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.24-0.81]), and improvement in NYHA class (RR, –0.52 [95% CI, –0.87 to –0.17]). 24 Conﬁrmatory evidence of the importance of adequate biventricular pacing per- centage is provided by an analysis of remote moni- toring data showing a strong association between increasing percentages of b iventricular pacing and r e d u c e dm o r t a l i t y ,w i t ht h eg r e a t e s tm a g n i t u d e reduction at >98% pacing. 53 In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 31 studies in 83,571 individuals, CRT alone did not improve the mortality rate in pa- tients with AF, but the all-cause mortality rate was lower in the AVNA group. 25 Many patients with CRT devices also have combined deﬁbrillator therapy. In a pooled analysis of 664 patients with AF and CRT in whom 282 underwent AVNA, a signi ﬁcant reduction in appropriate and inappropriate ICD shocks and a decrease in all-cause hospitalizations was associated with AVNA. 26 8. In an observational study of 24 patients with AF- induced cardiomyopathy and NYHA class III/IV HF, t h em e d i a nt i m ef r o mo n s e tof arrhythmia to cardio- myopathy and HF was 4.2 years. Aggressive rate/ rhythm control resulted in signiﬁcant LVEF recovery in all patients within 6 months. Five of 24 patients had recurrent AF, and all had a rapid decline in LVEF within 6 months after arrhythmia recurrence. 27 In an observational cohort of 69 patients with AF and LVEF <40% who underwent catheter ablation, pa- tients who maintained sinus rhythm (65%) had com- plete LV function recovery and maintained normal LVEF over 28/C6 11 months of follow-up, compared with those who had recurrent AF/AT. 28 Long-term sur- veillance to detect recurrent AF can be beneﬁcial and can be accomplished by various modalities, including wearable devices, smart watches, random monitoring (Holter, event, mobile telemetry), and implantable loop recorders.

In patients with arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy and HFrEF, the ideal target heart rate for rate control remains uncertain. However, because of the potential negative impact of rapid ventricular rates on HF and cardiomyopathy, a stricter rate-control strategy may be reasonable. In the AF-CHF trial, which compared rate control versus rhythm control using antiar- rhythmic therapy in AF and HFrEF, the target rate control was deﬁned as ventricular rate <80 bpm dur- ing resting 12-lead electrocardiography and <110 bpm during a 6-minute walk test. 29 In the RACE II trial, 614 patients with permanent AF were randomized to a heart rate <8 0b p ma tr e s ta n d<110 bpm during moderate exercise or lenient control (resting heart rate, <110 bpm), with results showing similar out- comes in each arm. However, RACE II trial patients were rate controlled at enrollment (baseline heart rate, 96 bpm), and only 15% of the study cohort had an LVEF <40%, plus very few patients had heart rates >100 bpm, even in the lenient rate control gorup. 54 In a crossover study of 20 patients with persistent AF and LVEF <40%, patients were given escalating doses of metoprolol (average dose, 121 mg) to get target heart rate <70 bpm. After 3 months, average resting heart rate decreased from 94/C6 14 bpm to 85/C6 12 bpm, but no signi ﬁcant differences in QOL on functional status were noted. 31 Strict rate control is also advis- able in patients with ICDs and CRT (See Table 20 in Section 7.1 , “Broad Considerations for Rate Control ”).55,56 10. In small observational series of patients undergoing AVNA and His bundle pacing, postprocedural in- crease in EF and improved functional class has been demonstrated, at the expense of increased pacing thresholds in some patients. 32,35 A single-center study comparing outcomes after AVNA with His bundle pacing and left bundle area pacing in 105 patients showed a higher rate of recurrent AVN conduction in the His bundle pacing group and longer ﬂuoroscopy time. 33 Acute threshold rise, exit block, and elevated long-term thresholds were also seen in the His bundle pacing group but not in left bundle area pacingin follow-up limited to 10.5 m o n t h s .B o t hs t r a t e g i e sw e r ea s s o c i a t e dw i t ha signi ﬁc a n t l yi m p r o v e dE Fi np a t i e n t sw i t hE F<50% at baseline (N ¼16; 37% /C6 7.6% versus 46% /C6 13%; P¼0.02). 33 An observational comparative study of patients undergoing AVNA, of whom 113 had RV (56) or BiV (57) pacing and 110 had conduction system pacing (84 His bundle pacing and 46 left bundle area pacing) showed increased EF in conduction system pacing compared with the mixed RV/BivP group (46.5% /C6 14.2% to 51.9% /C6 11.2%; P¼0.02) in conduc- tion system pacing and 36.4% /C6 16.1% to 39.5% /C6 16% (P¼0.04) in RV/BiVP. 34 A combined endpoint of time t od e a t ho rH Fh o s p i t a l i z a t i o nw a sr e d u c e di nt h e conduction system pacing group in >2y e a r so f follow-up, but extrapolation is limited due to the observational and selected nature of the population and because the RV/BiVP group had lower EF and wider QRS at baseline. 34 11. The nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers — diltiazem and verapamil — a r en e g a t i v ei n o t r o p i c agents and may not be tolerated in patients with HFrEF. In the acute setting, limited data from 2 retrospective analyses suggest the potential for increased morbidity with the use of diltiazem in pa- tients with HFrEF, including worsening HF, need for inotropic support, or acute kidney injury. 57,58 In the chronic setting, diltiazem had no impact on mortality in a trial of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopa- thy. 59 However, in the multicenter randomized MDPIT of patients postacute MI, HF and cardiac events (cardiac death or nonfatal reinfarction) were more frequent in the patients with LVEF <40% or pulmonary congestion who were randomized to dil- tiazem. Among those with a baseline EF of<40%, late HF appeared in 12% receiving placebo and 21% receiving diltiazem ( P¼0.004). Life table analysis in patients with an EF of<40% conﬁrmed more frequent late HF in those taking diltiazem ( P¼0.0017). In addition, the diltiazem-associated increase in the frequency of late HF was progressively greater with decreasing baseline EF. 36 This increase in late HF was not seen in patients with pulmonary congestion at baseline but an EF of $40%, suggesting the associa- tion of diltiazem-related late HF was present only in those with systolic LV dysfunction. 12. The ANDROMEDA 37 study was a randomized, double- blind placebo-controlle d study that tested the hy- pothesis that dronedarone would reduce the rate of hospitalization due to HF and possibly reduce mor- tality by reducing the incidence of arrhythmic death. The study enrolled patients who were hospitalized with new or worsening HF and who had at least 1 episode of NYHA class III orIV HF (shortness of breath on minimal exertion or at rest). More than 40% of the patients had NYHA class II HF at baseline. The in- vestigators reported that, contrary to the study’sh y - pothesis, mortality was higher in the dronedarone group compared to that in the placebo group (8.1% versus 3.8%; HR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.07-4.25];P¼0.03). The excess mortality was principally associated with worsening HF.

Management of Early Onset AF, Including Genetic Testing Synopsis Young patients are less likely to develop AF or associ- ated strokes compared with older populations. Consumer- driven use of wearable devices is increasing and can lead to the diagnosis of AF at a young age. 6 In those <30 years of age, reentrant SVTs (atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia) are found in about 25% of patients. 1-3 Targeted ablation of the reentrant tachycardia is followed by resolution of AF episodes in most of these young patients. However, additional factors need to be taken into consideration in young patients who present with AF. Growing evidence suggests that, in addition to risk factors for AF present in older populations, young patients who develop AF may also harbor susceptibility for inherited ion channel and cardiomyopathic disorders, 4 even in those with normal echocardiograms. 5 In addition to the standard workup for newly diagnosed AF, genetic testing for rare pathogenic variation, advanced imaging modalities, and surveillance screening could detect otherwise occult cardiomyopathy. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Two retrospective observational cohort studies included patients with onset of AF before the age of 21 years 2 a n d3 0y e a r s1 who underwent electrophysio- logical study to assess for reentrant SVTs. The former study found atrioventricul ar node reentry tachycardia or atrioventricular reentry tachycardia in 39% of pa- tients and the latter in 24%. In both studies, after tar- geted ablation of the reentry tachycardia, patients were observed for recurrence of AF for a median of about 1.5 years. The former study reported no recurrences of AF, and the latter study reported that 86% remained free of atrial arrhythmias. In an additional prospective cohort study of patients referred for AF ablation who had inducible atrioventricular n ode reentry tachycardia, 12 of 13 patients who underwe nt slow pathway ablation without PVI had no recurrence of AF after a mean follow-up of 21 months. 3 2. A prospective observational cohort study in patients with AF diagnosed before the age of 66 years and who had sequencing of genes typically found in ion chan- nelopathy and cardiomyopathy panels reported that among 1,293 patients studied, 10% (131) were found to have a disease-associated variant, primarily in cardiomyopathy-related genes. 4 In 1 study of 23 unre- lated patients with onset of AF at<45 years of age who had a normal echocardiogr am and no other readily identi ﬁable causes of AF, 24% had a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant identiﬁed. Most of these were also in cardiomyopathy-related genes. 5 10.2. Athletes Recommendations for Management of Earl y Onset AF, Including Genetic Testing Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 2b B-NR 1. In patients with an onset of unexplained AF before 30 years of age, electrophysiological study to evaluate and treat reentrant supraventricular tachyarrhyt hmias with a targeted ablation may be reasonable because of the high prevalence of reentrant arrhythmias in this group.1-3 2b B-NR 2. In patents with an onset of AF before 45 years of age without obvious risk factors for AF, referral for genetic counseling, geneti c testing for rare pathogenic variants, and surveillance for cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia syndromes may be reasonable. 4,5 Recommendation for Athletes Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 2a B-NR 1. In athletes who develop AF, catheter ablation with PVI is a reasonable strategy for rhythm control because of its effectiveness and low risk of detrimental effect on exercise capacity.1,2 JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 217 Synopsis Engaging in moderate levels of exercise has several cardiovascular bene ﬁts and, in some studies, has been associated with a lower incidence of AF. 3,4 However, high-volume endurance athleticism, de ﬁned here as ex- ercise of >45 metabolic equivalent-hours per week, has been associated with a higher prevalence of AF,5 partic- ularly in young athletes. 6 The mechanisms behind this association are not well established but may be related to atrial myopathy from exercise-induced stretch or perhaps inﬂamation. 7,8 No studies have prospectively studied the effects of detraining on AF burden, but some have pro- posed that moderation of exercise may be considered, although it is unclear whether changes are reversible. 9 Nevertheless, athletes will often choose to continue sport participation, and aggressive rhythm control stra- tegies are often sought. Because many of these patients are young, medications are often not tolerated or preferred. PVI has been shown to be safe and effective in this population without resulting in a signi ﬁcant reduc- tion in exercise capacity 1 and has been shown to signiﬁ- cantly improve QOL.2 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In a prospective cohort study of 144 athletes, AF abla- tion with PVI, including multiple procedures, resulted in freedom from AF at 1 year in 86% of athletes with paroxysmal AF and 68% of athletes with persistent AF over a median follow-up of 3 years. 1 Athletes under- went cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing before and after ablation and, although the sinus rate increased on average 10 bpm after ablation (which may bother some athletes and thus should be discussed before the procedure), no signi ﬁcant changes were observed in maximum metabolic equivalents on exer- cise treadmill testing. In a retrospective cohort study of 133 competitive athletes who underwent catheter ablation for AF with 10-year follow-up, 83% of athletes did not have recurrent events and had signi ﬁcantly improved QOL scores. 2 10.3. Management Considerations in Patients With AF and Obesity Obesity is a strongrisk factor for AF.1 In the Framingham Study, overweight and obesity increased the risk of inci- dent AF, with a 4% increase in AF risk per unit increase in B M Ii nm e na n dw o m e n .A d j u s t e dH R sf o rA Fa s s o c i a t e d with obesity were 1.52 (95% CI, 1.09-2.13;P¼0.02) and 1.46 (95% CI, 1.03-2.07; P¼0.03) for men and women, respec- tively, compared with individuals with normal BMI. In t h a ts t u d y ,t h ee x c e s sr i s ko fA Fa s s o c i a t e dw i t ho b e s i t y appeared to be mediated through LA dilatation. 2 Other studies suggest that the risk of AF with obesity is medi- ated through epicardial and abdominal fat, or structural changes in the atria. 1,3 Obesity is also associated with other comorbidities, including hypertension, HF, and sleep apnea, which themselvespredispose to an increased incidence of AF. Further, higher BMI and obesity are associated with an increase in the burden of AF, including progression from paroxysmal to permanent AF, and an i n c r e a s e dr i s ko fA Fr e c u r r e n c ea f t e rA Fa b l a t i o n . 4 Special considerations for the management of AF in patients with o b e s i t yi n c l u d et h er o l eo fw e i g h tl o s si nt h ep r i m a r ya n d secondary prevention of AF ( Section 5 , “Lifestyle and Risk Factor Modiﬁcation for AF Management”), as well as anticoagulation in patients with severe or class III obesity in this section and in Section 10.4 (“Anticoagulation Considerations in Patients With Class III Obesity”). 10.4. Anticoagulation Considerations in Patients With Class III Obesity Recommendations for Anticoagulation Considerations in Patients With Class III Obesity Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 2a B-NR 1. In patients with AF and class III obesity (BMI‡40 kg/m2), DOACs are reasonable to choose over warfarin for stroke risk reduction.1-5 2b C-LD 2. In patients with AF who have undergone bariatric surgery, warfarin may be reasonable to choose over DOACs for stroke risk reduction in view of concerns about DOAC drug absorption.6,7 Synopsis Patients with class III obesity (BMI $40 kg/m2)a r eu n - derrepresented in the major clinical trials evaluating the efﬁcacy and safety of DOACs in patients with AF. Post hoc analyses of major DOAC trials in AF and large observa- tional studies have shown comparable efﬁcacy and safety of DOACs compared with warfarin across weight groups, including patients with class III obesity. 1-5 Thus, DOACs are preferred over warfarin for stroke risk prevention in patients with class III obesity and AF. Little evidence is available that evaluates the pharmacokinetics, ef ﬁcacy, and safety of DOACs in patients with AF who have Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 218 undergone bariatric surgery. Thus, warfarin may be reasonable to choose over DOACs to reduce stroke risk in this population until further data become available. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Post hoc analyses of the ARISTOTLE (apixaban versus warfarin), ROCKET AF (rivaroxaban versus warfarin), and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (edoxaban versus warfarin) demonstrated consistent ef ﬁcacy (stroke and systemic embolism) and safety (major bleeding) of DOACs compared with warfarin across weight groups in pa- tients with AF. 3-5 A meta-analysis including these trials and RE-LY (dabigatran versus warfarin) again showed similar ef ﬁcacy and safety of DOACs compared with warfarin, although the outcome differences were attenuated in obese patients. 2 Al a r g er e t r o s p e c t i v e observational study including 36,094 patients compared risk of ischemic stroke, signiﬁcant bleeding, and mortality in patients receiving a DOAC or warfarin, strati ﬁed by BMI group. 1 For all 3 endpoints, better outcomes were observed with DOACs across BMI groups. In patients with a BMI $40 kg/m2,ar e l a t i v e risk reduction of 25% for ischemic stroke (adjusted HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.64-0.87]; P<0.001), 57% for signiﬁcant bleeding (adjusted HR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.20-0.94]; P<0.001), and 34% for all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.56-0.77]; P<0.001) was observed with DOACs compared with warfarin. 2. Although case reports exist that demonstrate expected factor Xa trough levels in patients taking a DOAC who undergo bariatric surgery, a meta-analysis of cohort studies, case series, and case reports has shown that 42% of patients who have undergone bariatric surgery had peak drug levels below the expected range. 6,7 Pa- tients who have undergone bariatric surgery are not well represented in any of the major trials comparing DOACs with warfarin, and few observational data support DOAC use in this population. Warfarin’st h e r - apeutic effect can be routinely monitored. Thus, in patients with AF who have undergone bariatric sur- gery, warfarin may be a reas o n a b l ec h o i c eo v e rD O A C s for stroke risk reduction at this time. 10.5. AF and VHD VHD and AF commonly coexist. AF independently pre- dicts the risk of cerebrovascular events among patients with valve disease. 1 This risk may be addressed with the use of oral anticoagulation, percutaneous and surgical LAAO, and surgical ablation as described inSections 6.5.1 (“Percutaneous Approaches to Occlude the LAA ”), 6.5.2 (“Cardiac Surgery — LAA Exclusion/Excision ”), and 6.8.5 (“AF in VHD”). 10.6. WPW and Preexcitation Syndromes Recommendations for WPW and Preexcitation Syndromes Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. Patients with AF with rapid anterograde conduction(preexcited AF), and hemodynamic instability should be treated with electrical cardioversion. 1,2 1 B-NR 2. For patients with AF with rapid anterograde conduction (preexcited AF), catheter ablation of accessory pathways (APs) is recommended. 3-7 1 C-LD 3. In patients with AF with rapid anterograde conduction (preexcited AF) and hemodynamic stability, pharmacological cardioversion with intravenous ibu tilide or intravenous procainamide is recommended as an alternative to elective cardioversion. 1,8,9 3: Harm B-NR 4. For patients with AF with anterograde accessory pathway conduction (preexcited AF), pharmacological agents that block atrioventricular nodal conduction (verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone, digoxin, adenosine, or beta blockers) are contraindicated due to risk ofprecipitating VF or hemodynamic deterioration. 10-14 Synopsis WPW and preexcitation syndromes refer to the pres- ence of extra-atrioventricular nodal connection(s) be- tween atrium and ventricle; such APs are comprised of atrial tissue. 15 AF occurs in approximately 15% of persons with WPW and although the mechanism(s) remain un- clear, the faster conduction p roperties of atrial tissue compared with the atrioventricular node allow for rapid rates in preexcited AF. 15-17 T h er i s ko fp r e e x c i t e dA Fi s higher for those with multiple pathways and short ante- grade pathway refractory period (<250 ms), which allows rapid conduction and predisposes to VF and sudden death. 1,18,19 Moreover, AF in young persons without evi- dence of comorbid conditions may be associated with an AP, and pathway ablation is deﬁnitive therapy for AF and SVT in these persons. 1 For those who cannot undergo ablation, preventive pharmacological therapy is directed to slowing pathway conduction.20,21 JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 219 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Preexcited AF can conduct rapidly over the pathway and lead to VF. During an acute episode of preexcited AF with rapid ventricular response and hemodynamic instability, electrical cardioversion must be used to restore sinus rhythm. 1,2 2. Pathway ablation has well-established efﬁcacy and safety for those with preexcited AF for prevention of VF.1 Multiple large-patient series point to a high success rate (93%-95%) balanced with low risk of major short- and long-term com- plications.3-7 Electrophysiological study and AP ablation can be offered asﬁrst-line therapy. 3. Pharmacological treatments that increase the refractory period of atrial tissue (ie, ibutilide or procainamide) can slow AP conduction and terminate AF. Hemodynami- c a l l ys t a b l ep a t i e n t sp r e s e n t i n gw i t hp r e e x c i t e dA Fw i t h or without rapid ventricular rates can be pharmacolog- ically managed with such agents. 8,9 In 1 study involving 22 patients, ibutilide terminated AF in 21 patients and prolonged refractoriness of the atrioventricular node, His-Purkinje system, and AP. 9 4. AP conduction can accelerate with atrioventricular nodal block. Administration of pharmacological agents that block atrioventricular nodal conduction can in- crease the risk of VF. The use of atrioventricular nodal b l o c k i n ga g e n t sf o rp a t i e n t sw i t hp r e e x c i t e dA Fa r e potentially harmful due to the risk of accelerated pathway conduction and associated VF. 1,10-12 One small series that reviewed intravenous amiodarone for this indication raised signiﬁcant concerns in view of several p u b l i s h e dr e p o r t so ni n s t a n c e so fV Fp r e c i p i t a t e db y amiodarone. 13 In 1 study of patients with WPW who received verapamil during electrophysiological study, verapamil decreased the shortest RR interval between preexcited ventricular complexes during AF, and 2 patients deteriorated and required cardioversion. 14 Data are very limited and observational, but because other safer options are readily available, atrioventric- ular nodal agents are best avoided in this setting. 10.7. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy The “AHA/ACC Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy” was pub- lished in December 2020, and this guideline included rec- ommendations on AF.1 Data on AF in patients with HCM published since the 2020 hyp ertrophic cardiomyopathy guideline were reviewed but did not result in any substan- tive changes in the recommendations from 2020.2-6 AF is highly prevalent in HCM and increases the risk of stroke. The CHA2DS2-VASc score should not apply to patients with HCM, because they have roughly an equivalent risk to a CHADs- VASc of 3. Data on the use of DOACs in patients with HCM suggest these to be acceptable alternatives to warfarin. When a rhythm-control strategy is needed, several antiar- rhythmic drugs have been shown to be safe and effective, allowing for individualizat ion according to underlying substrate and patient preference. Catheter ablation is also an important option, although more conﬁrmatory studies have shown AF ablation is of lower success compared with patients without HCM. 7 For speciﬁcs, please see the“2020 AHA/ACC Guideline for the D iagnosis and Treatment of Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.”1 10.8. Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) Recommendations for ACHD Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. In adults with congenital heart disease and AF, it isrecommended to evaluate for and treat precipitating factors and reversible causes of AF, recognizing that residual hemodynamic sequalae may contribute to the occurrence of the arrhythmia.1,2 1 C-LD 2. In adults with AF and moderate or complex congenitalheart disease, electrophysiological procedures should be performed by operators with expertise inACHD procedures and in collaboration with an ACHD cardiologist, ideally in specialized centers, when available. 3-5 1 C-LD 3. In adults with congenital heart disease and symptomatic or hemodynamically signiﬁcant paroxysmal or persistent AF, an initial strategy of rhythm control is recommended regardless of lesion severity as AF in this population is often poorly tolerated.6 2a B-NR 4. In symptomatic patients with simple congenital heart disease with antiarrhythmic drug–refractory AF, it is reasonable to choose ablation over long-term antiarrhythmic therapies. 4,7 2b C-LD 5. In adults with congenital heart disease with AF undergoing PVI, it may be reasonable to include an ablative strategy in the right atrium directed at reentrant arrhythmia secondary to atriotomy scars and the CTI.8,9 2b C-LD 6. In adults with AF and moderate or severe forms of congenital heart disease, particularly those with low-ﬂow states such as Fontan circulation, blind-ending cardiac chambers, and cyanosis, it may be reasonable to treat with anticoagulation independent of conventional risk score to reduce risk of thromboembolic events.10 Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 220 Synopsis Atrial arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity in adults with congenital heart disease, and AF surpasses intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia in patients with CHD >50 years of age. 11 Risk factors for development of AF in patients with ACHD are similar to those for the general population; however, the presence of an atrial septal defect is an independent risk factor. Adults may be clas- siﬁed as having simple, moderate, or complex forms of CHD, based on a classiﬁcation proposed in the“2018 AHA/ ACC Guideline for the Management of Adults With Congenital Heart Disease. ” 12 Choosing pharmacological therapy for treatment of patients with ACHD who have AF should consider factors such as coexisting sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block, as well as the ven- tricular function and other comorbidities. Ablation stra- tegies established in normal hearts can be applied to patients with simple forms of CHD; however, caution must be taken in those patients with moderate or complex forms of ACHD. 13 Knowledge of the underlying congenital anatomy is key, because access to the atrial chambers may require specialized approaches. In those patients with moderate or complex forms of CHD, electrophysiological procedures should be performed by operators with expertise in CHD and in collaboration with an ACHD cardiologist. 3 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Adults with CHD often have hemodynamic sequalae of childhood repair, and any new onset arrhythmia, including AF, should prompt an evaluation for treat- able and reversible causes. Studies have shown that AF is correlated with RA dilation, thus necessitating addressing the underlying substrate in addition to treating the arrhythmia. 1,2 2. Patients with ACHD who a re undergoing invasive electrophysiological procedures in specialized ACHD centers generally have better outcomes, including survival, than those managedi no t h e rc a r es e t t i n g s .3-5 Special attention is required to ensure appropriate periprocedural care, including identi ﬁcation of procedure-related risk factors and availability of ancillary imaging. 12 3. Adults with simple forms of CHD and AF are generally managed according to standard published guidelines. In those patients with moderate or complex forms of CHD, choice of antiarrhythmic therapy should be individualized. 6 Most antiarrhythmic drugs are asso- ciated with proarrhythmic effects and increased mor- tality in ACHD patients. 14 Rhythm control is generally preferred over rate control in patients with ACHD with moderate or complex disease who may tolerate AF poorly. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs must be avoided in patients with ACHD with CAD or signi ﬁcant subpulmonary or systemic ventricular dysfunction. 14-16 Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent for maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with ACHD; however, long-term therapy is limited by adverse ef- fects, particularly amiodaro ne-induced thyrotoxicosis, w h i c hi sc o m m o ni nw o m e nw i t hC H D ,c y a n o t i cC H D , and those with Fontan physiology. 17 Amiodarone should also be avoided in patients with ACHD who have a BMI<21 kg/m 2 due to the increased incidence of thyrotoxicosis in these patients. 18 Dofetilide may be a viable alternative to amiodarone in this complex pop- ulation. 19 Extrapolating data from noncongenital pop- ulations, dronedarone is best avoided in patients with A C H Dw h oh a v em o d e r a t eo rc o m p l e xd i s e a s eo rs i g - niﬁcant ventricular dysfunction due to the increased risk of HF, stroke, and death.20,21 4. Data on ablative strategies for AF in patients with ACHD are limited; however, when performed by experienced centers, AF ablation in patients with simple forms of CHD is safe. 4,13 Knowledge of the un- derlying congenital anatomy is key, as access to the atrial chambers may requi re different approaches, including transseptal puncture. Patients with ACHD who have persistent AF have lower success rates for ablation, and multiple procedures may be required. 22 There are insuf ﬁcient data on the role, safety, and beneﬁto fA Fa b l a t i o ni nc o m p l e xf o r m so fC H D . 5. PVI has a lower success rate in patients with ACHD than in patients with structurally normal hearts. The operator should understand the variations in systemic and pulmonary venous anatomy, such as a left superior vena cava, which may be a trigger for AF. 9 Due to related pathology in the right atrium of patients with repaired complex ACHD, additional ablative therapies directed at atriotomy scars and the CTI may be neces- sary. Cryoballoon ablation is a safe option for patients with simple or moderate forms of CHD and AF. 23,24 6. All patients with CHD should be considered for some form of thromboembolic prophylaxis. Select groups of patients with CHD are at higher risks for thromboem- bolic events, such as cyanotic lesions, those with low- ﬂow states (Fontan physiology), and those with blind- ending cardiac chambers. The prevalence of cerebro- vascular accidents in patients with ACHD is estimated to be 10- to 100-fold higher than age-matched controls, and thromboembolic events account for at least 4% of all-cause mortality in patients with CHD. 25 Increased complexity of CHD is associated with thromboembolic events, but CHA 2DS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores are not predictive of thromboembolic risk in patients with ACHD; therefore, therapies must be individualized. 10 Limited data are available for the use of DOACs in pa- tients with ACHD, but in a survey, they appeared to be safe and effective. 26 JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 221 10.9. Prevention and Treatment of AF After Cardiac Surgery 10.9.1. Prevention of AF After Cardiac Surgery Synopsis New-onset AF after cardiac surgery is common and has been associated with increased risks of late mortality and stroke. 8 Trials of prophylactic amiodarone and beta blockers have demonstrated effectiveness reducing the occurrence of new AF, but not in all studies. Building off previous studies, the PALACS (Effect of Posterior Peri- cardiotomy on the Incidence of Atrial Fibrillation After Cardiac Surgery) randomized trial studied the use of posterior left pericardiotomy 7 and found signi ﬁcant reduction of AF in the treated group (17% versus 32% no intervention group; P¼0.0007; OR, 0.44). Colchicine has shown uncertain bene ﬁt based on the results of more recent studies compared with earlier encouraging trials. Drug adverse effects result in frequent drug discontinu- ation. 9-11 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Preoperative prophylaxi s with beta blockers or amio- darone has shown mixed bene ﬁt, and studies are difﬁcult to compare because of variable medication combinations. 1-5 One double-blind RCT of 601 patients listed for nonemergency CABG surgery and/or valve replacement/repair surgery showed a signi ﬁcant reduction of AF with amiodarone. 2. A meta-analysis and RCT showed that the incidence of postoperative AF was signi ﬁcantly lower in patients treated with posterior left pericardiotomy during their cardiac procedure; howev er, the studies did not include patients undergo ing mitral or tricuspid procedures. 6,7 Recommendations for Prevention of AF After Cardiac Surgery Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement .

Treatment of AF After Cardiac Surgery Synopsis For new-onset AF after cardiac surgery, rate control is typically managed with beta blockers, or calcium channel blockers. 1-4 A randomized trial showed no signi ﬁcant clinical differences comparing a strategy of rate-control versus rhythm-control medications for patients who are hemodynamically stable. 5 For those with poorly controlled AF, cardioversion is reasonable, but for those with >48 hours of AF, imaging of the LAA (even if surgically closed) should be considered.5,6 The use of cardioversion and im- aging in postoperative patients is a judgment call consid- ering the patient ’s clinical condition. For patients who develop postoperative AF, including during follow-up postdischarge, rhythm assessment, and possible cardio- version for the small number who are still in AF, should be considered. 5,6 Colchicine had been shown to be effective, b u tm o r er e c e n ts t u d i e sd i dn o tc o nﬁrm this, and gastro- intestinal adverse effects may be signiﬁcant. 8-10 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. The use of beta blockers to control heart rate is well documented. 1-4 Calcium channel blockers are an option for rate control when beta blockers are ineffective.5 2. The use of rate control or rhythm control are both acceptable options in hemodynamically stable patients because neither has a distinct clinical advantage over the other based on a randomized study that included 529 patients. In this study, patients in the rhythm- control group received amiodarone. 5,6 3. Cardioversion of patients with sustained postoperative AF is regularly performed, especially for those patients with hemodynamically poorly tolerated AF. Cardio- version is routinely combined with pharmacological therapy, especially amiodarone. 5,6 4. A review of 8 observational studies that included 15,335 patients found a protective impact on the mor- tality rate at 5 years but no differences in thrombo- embolic events in patients with postoperative AF treated with anticoagulants. 7 In general, the duration of anticoagulation is a minimum of 60 days; in the randomized trial of rate control versus rhythm control, if patients remained in AF or had recurrent AF 48 hours after randomization, anticoagulation was recom- mended to be continued for 60 days, unless compli- cations occurred. Patients should be evaluated before discontinuation to deter mine underlying rhythm, especially those at high risk for stroke. 5. The need for a rhythm-con trol strategy should be evaluated postdischarge. Patients who tolerate rate control can be followed and often convert spontane- ously after 6 to 8 weeks. A net advantage of rate control is earlier discharge in hemodynamically stable pa- tients. Those who do not convert can be managed accordingly with rhythm-control strategy. 5,6 Recommendations for Treatment of AF After Cardiac Surgery Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 A* 1. In postoperative cardiac surgery patients, beta blockers * are recommended to achieve rate control for AF1-4 unless contraindicated or ineffective in which case a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker† is recommended. 5B-R† 1 B-R 2. In hemodynamically stable cardiac surgery patient s with postoperative AF, rate-control (target heart rate, <100 bpm) and/or rhythm-control medications are recommended as initial therapy, with the choice of strategy according to patient symptoms, hemodynamic consequences of the arrhythmia, and physician preference. 5,6 1 B-R 3. In patients who develop poorly tolerated AF after cardiac surgery, direct current cardioversion in com- bination with antiarrhythmic drug therapy is recommended, with consideration of imaging to rule out left appendage thrombus before cardioversion in those patients in whom AF has been present>48 hours and who have not been on anticoagulation.5,6 2a B-NR 4. In patients who develop postoperative AF after cardiac surgery, it is reasonable to administer anti- coagulation when deemed safe in regard to surgical bleeding for 60 days after surgery unless compli- cations develop and to reevaluate the need for longer term anticoagulation at that time.5,7 2a C-LD 5. In patients who develop AF after cardiac surgery and who are treated with rate-control strategy, at 30- to 60-day follow-up it is reasonable to perform rhythm assessment and, if AF does not revert to sinus rhythm spontaneously, consider cardioversion a fter an adequate duration of anticoagulation. 5,6 *A LOE applies to the data on beta blockers.†B-R LOE applies to the data on nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

Recommendations for Acute Medical Illness o r Surgery (Including AF in Critical Care) Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. Patients with AF who are identiﬁed in the setting of acute medical illness or surgery should be counseled about the signiﬁcant risk of recurrent AF after the acute illness is resolved.1-6 2a B-NR 2. In patients with AF who are identiﬁed in the setting of acute medical illness or surgery, outpatient follow- up for thromboembolic risk stratiﬁcation and decision-making on OAC initiation or continuation, as well as AF surveillance, can be beneﬁcial given a high risk of AF recurrence.4-9 2b B-NR 3. In patients with AF who are identiﬁed in the setting of critical illness due to sepsis, the beneﬁts of anticoagulation during critical illne ss for stroke prevention are uncertain.10,11 Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 224 Synopsis AF identiﬁed in the setting of hospitalization for acute noncardiac illness (acute AF), including patients who are critically ill, may represent new-onset AF that has been detected and treated for the ﬁrst time. Incidence ranges from 1% to 46% in medical illness, 1,12-14 with 6% to 22% in severe sepsis,15 and 3% to 16% after noncardiac surgery.16 A Fc a nb ea ni n c i d e n t a lﬁnding during low-risk proced- ures but can occur associated with a range of conditions, including critical illness or sepsis. A combination of un- derlying arrhythmogenic substrate and triggers related to the acute illness likely contribute to acute AF. Acute AF can be paroxysmal or persistent, with or without symp- toms, and is associated with higher risk of AF recur- rence. 1-3 Acute AF is also associated with prolonged hospitalization 13,14 as well as increased morbidity12,15 and mortality. 13,15 Management of acute AF is directed toward detection and treatment of potential triggers, optimizing hemodynamics, rate and/or rhythm control, and reducing in-hospital and long-term risk of stroke. Rate- or rhythm- control strategy should be individualized, balancing the impact of rapid rates and atrioventricular dyssynchrony on hemodynamics with ability to tolerate treatment. De- cisions regarding initiating anticoagulation should be based on risk strati ﬁcation of patient substrate and comorbidities, and the timing should take into consider- ation bleeding risks and the complexity of the acute illness. Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. In patients who develop or are discovered to have AF in the setting of acute medical illness and noncardiac surgery, recurrent AF was noted in 42% to 68% 1,2 and 39%,3 respectively, during 5-year follow-up. Regardless of presence of an initial precipitant, recurrent AF was associated with increased risks of HF (HR, 2.74 [95% CI, 2.39-3.15]; P<0.001), stroke (HR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.30- 1.90]; P<0.001), and mortality (HR, 2.96 [95% CI, 2.70- 3.24]; P<0.001). 2 2. In 10,723 patients with newly diagnosed AF (67.9/C6 –9.9 years, 41% women) identi ﬁed from a longitudinal database, 19% of patients had an acute AF precipitant, the most common being cardiac surgery (22%), pneu- monia (20%), and noncardiac surgery (15%). AF recur- rence at 5 years was 41% among those with a precipitant versus 52% in those without one (adjusted HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.69-0.81]; P<0.001) ( Figure 27 ). 3 Regardless of a precipitant, recurrent AF was FIGURE 27 Unadjusted Cumulative Risk of AF Recurrence Unadjusted curves displaying cumulative risk of recurrent AF, generated using Kaplan-Meier method.

In patients with acute AF after cardiac surgery, observational studies show that those who underwent continuous rhythm monitoring had a higher detection of AF. 4-6 No randomized clinical trial has speci ﬁcally compared different monitoring strategies for outpatient follow-up of patients with acute AF. However, parallels could be drawn from studies like the CRYSTAL-AF 8 and SEARCH-AF (Post-Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation) 9 trials, which showed increased sensitivity for AF detection with long-term monitoring. Close outpatient follow-up with consideration of heart rhythm monitoring and thr omboembolic risk strati ﬁ- cation is important considering the high risk of AF recurrence in these patients, especially in those who underwent noncardiac surgery and with risk factors for stroke in whom the AF is likely to recur (Figure 28). The optimal frequency, duration, and type of rhythm monitoring for patients with acute AF remain unclear and need further study. 3. In a retrospective cohort study of 38,582 patients with AF and sepsis admitted to US hospitals from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2013, 13,611 patients (35.3%) received parenteral anticoagulation for AF. The CHA 2DS2-VASc score was a poor predictor of acute stroke risk, and parenteral anticoagulation did not reduce stroke risk (1.3% versus 1.4%; RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.77-1.15]) and was associated with an increased risk of clinically signi ﬁcant bleeding (8.6% versus 7.2%; RR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.10-1.32]). Risk of stroke did not differ whether patients had preexisting AF and new onset AF. 10 In a retrospective cohort study of 102 patients $65 years of age who were hospitalized with sepsis and with new-onset AF, 28% received a pre- scription for OACs within 30 days of admission. Over 3-year follow-up, no signiﬁcant association was noted between anticoagulation and a lower incidence of ischemic stroke (OR, 1.98 [95% CI, 0.29-13.47]) or bleeding (OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.29-3.21]). 11 Gaps in knowledge exist, and further research is needed to better understand the bene ﬁts and risks of acute and long-term anticoagulation i n critically ill patients with acute AF.

Hyperthyroidism Synopsis Hyperthyroidism, de ﬁned as elevated blood levels of t h y r o i dh o r m o n ew i t hr e d u c e dl e v e l so ft h y r o i d -s t i m u - lating hormone, is relatively common and may not lead to overt symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. 3,4 Patients with hy- perthyroidism are at increased risk of developing AF, 5 which resolves in most cases after the restoration of the euthyroid state with effective antithyroid treatment. 6,7 Excess thyroid hormone increases sensitivity to cate- cholamines, 3,8 and beta blockers reduce symptoms and tachycardia in patients with hyperthyroidism. 9-12 Nonse- lective beta blockers may reduce the systemic symptoms of hyperthyroidism a bit more than beta-1 –selective agents do, and propranolol reduces the peripheral con- version of T4 to T3. 10,13 Although it is uncertain whether hyperthyroidism is an independent risk factor for stroke, many patients have other risk factors that elevate stroke risk, and anticoagulation reduces risk of stroke to a similar extent among patients with and without hyper- thyroidism. 1,2,14 Restoration of sinus rhythm is unlikely until a euthyroid state has been achieved 15 and, in 1 study, spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm occurred at a median of 1 to 3 weeks after thyroid hormone levels returned to normal. 6 Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. Patients with hyperthyro idism often have laboratory ﬁndings that suggest hypercoagulability, 16 b u ti ti s uncertain whether this translates into a higher risk of stroke. 1,17 Nevertheless, patients with hyperthyroidism are commonly at elevated risk of stroke due to other clinical factors, so anticoagulation should be considered using the framework in Section 6.3.1 (“Antithrombotic Therapy ”). A Danish national regis- try study found that patients with thyrotoxicosis and AF had a lower overall risk of thromboembolic events but a similar reduction in the risk of thromboembolic events from anticoagulation compared with patients who did not have a secondary cause of AF. 5 In a large, randomized trial of apixaban versus warfarin, patients with a history of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism had risk of stroke similar to that of patients with no history of thyroid disease, and the effectiveness of apixaban in reducing stroke was consistent across subgroups with and without a history of thyroid disease. 16 10.12. Pulmonary Disease Recommendation for Hyperthyroidism Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 B-NR 1. In patients with hyperthyroidism and AF who have an elevated risk of stroke based on a standard clinical risk score, anticoagulation is recommended until t hyroid function has returned to normal and sinus rhythm can be maintained.1,2 Recommendations for Pulmonary Disease Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 2a B-R 1. In patients with AF and COPD, it is reasonable to use cardioselective beta blockers for rate control of AF, especially where other indications exist (eg, MI and HF).1-3 2a B-NR 2. In patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) withpulmonary vascular disease and AF or AFL, a rhythm- control strategy is reasonable to improve functional status and potentially prolong survival. 4-12 Synopsis Pulmonary disease is commonly associated with ar- rhythmias. AF is common in COPD and is associated with an increased risk of mortality and bleeding. 13 The combi- nation of AF and asthma is less common, and beta blockers are generally avoided to prevent bronchospasm. A bidirectional relationship is seen between AF and pul- monary embolus (PE), although it is little studied. The risk of PE is increased in patients with AF. 14 AF may also complicate acute PE, where it is a marker of increased risk of mortality. 15 Whether AF in the setting of PE should in- ﬂuence the intensity or duration of anticoagulation, or is JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 227 associated with future AF recurrence, is unknown. AF and other supraventricular arrhythmias are important causes of decompensation in patients with PH, which is espe- cially well described in World Health Organization groups 1 and 4. A successful rhythm-control strategy is associated with better outcomes in these patients. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. AF is common in patients with COPD, with a prevalence of 11% in a large European registry. 16 Furthermore, patients with COPD often have other concomitant heart disease. Because beta-2 agonists can be used for the treatment of COPD, there has been a reluctance to prescribe beta blockers in case these would antagonize beta-2 agonists or precipitate bronchospasm. 17 How- ever, a systematic review and meta-analysis of obser- vational studies found that beta-blocker use, for diverse indications including HF and CAD, was associ- ated with a signiﬁcantly reduced risk of mortality in patients with COPD. 1 Another meta-analysis of RCTs assessing the effect of cardioselective beta blockers on respiratory function and symptoms did not ﬁnd any change in these parameters or in response to beta-2 agonists. 2 An RCT of patients with advanced COPD at risk of severe exacerbation, but without an indication f o rb e t a - b l o c k e rt r e a t m e n t, found no difference in the time to ﬁrst exacerbation but didﬁnd an increased risk of severe exacerbation. 3 Therefore, although other agents can be used for rate control of AF (Section 7, “Rate Control ”), beta blockers, especially car- dioselective beta blockers, for treatment of AF need not be avoided when indicated, especially in patients with less than severe COPD. However, beta blockers can exacerbate reactive airway disease and are generally avoided in that setting, such as in patients with asthma. 2. Atrial arrhythmias are common in PH with pulmonary vascular disease (PH PVD; hemodynamically de ﬁned as PH with increased pulmonary vascular resistance and normal left heart ﬁlling pressures, typical of World Health Organization group 1 but also of groups 3 and 4). Right atrial contraction accounts for a signi ﬁcantly greater proportion of total right heart function in pa- tients with PH PVD than in normal subjects, 18 and the onset of atrial arrhythmia is frequently associated with clinical deterioration. 4-12 Restoration of sinus rhythm results in improvement, whereas persistent arrhythmia or recurrence is associated with mortality. 4,8,9 Phar- macological rhythm control and cardioversion have both been used, although negative inotropy may limit antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Catheter ablation of typical AFL has been well described in patients with PH PVD, with acceptable results and safety, as well as improvement in clinical and hemodynamic parame- ters. 5,7,12 LA ablation has also been described, although the possibility of creating a right-to-left shunt should always be considered when planning transseptal puncture. Anesthetic management is also complex, and these patients are best cared for by centers with extensive clinical expertise in these conditions. 10.13. Pregnancy Recommendations for Pregnancy Referenced studies that support the recommendations are summarized in the Online Data Supplement . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-NR 1. In pregnant patients with AF, DCCV is safe to the patient and fetus and should be performed in the same manner as in patients who are not pregnant.1 2b C-LD 2. In pregnant individuals with structurally normal hearts and hemodynamically stable AF, pharmacological cardioversion with agents with history of safe use in pregnancy, such as intravenous procainamide, may be considered. 1,2 2a C-LD 3. In pregnant individuals with AF and without structural heart disease, antiarrhythmic agents with history of safe use in pregnancy (eg,ﬂecainide and sotalol) are reasonable for maintenance of sinus rhythm.1,2 2a B-NR 4. In pregnant individuals with persistent AF, rate-control agents with a record of safety in pregnancy, such as beta blockers (eg, propranolol or metoprolol) anddigoxin, either alone or in combination with beta blockers, are reasonable as ﬁrst-line agents. 1,2 2b C-LD 5. Pregnant individuals with AF and elevated risk of stroke may be considered for anticoagulation with the recognition that no anticoagulation strategy is completely safe for both the mother and fetus, and an SDM discussion should take place regarding risks to both mother and fetus (Table 28).3 Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 228 Synopsis The incidence of atrial arrhythmias is rising in preg- nancy, and data from the national inpatient sample sug- gest that this is largely driven by increasing incidence of AF, with a reported frequency of 27 per 100,000 hospi- talizations. 4 The incidence of AF/AFL in pregnant pa- tients with heart disease is 1.3%, with a peak occurrence between 23 and 30 weeks gestation. 5,6 Hospitalizations during pregnancy for arrhythmias are associated with an increased risk of maternal and fetal adverse outcomes. AF during pregnancy is associated with increased maternal mortality (OR, 13.13 [95% CI, 7.77-22.21]; P<0.0001). 9 Atrial arrhythmias may manifest for the ﬁrst time during pregnancy; however, AF is usually associated with underlying structural or CHD. Factors associated with an increased incidence of AF in pregnant individuals include advanced maternal age, 6 African American race, lower socioeconomic status, and left-sided obstructive le- sions. 4,5 Obesity is associated with the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, which is also a known risk factor for AF. 7 Another potential mechanism for development of AF in pregnancy is the cardiogastric interaction that occurs with elevated progesterone levels, leading to gastroesophageal reﬂux disease. 8 In patients deemed to be at high risk of stroke, rec- ommendations for anticoagulation in pregnancy are extrapolated from experience in managing VHD. DOACs are contraindicated during pr egnancy and during breast- feeding because of a lack of data to support their safety and efﬁcacy in this patient population. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Rapid atrioventricular conduction may have serious hemodynamic consequences for both mother and fetus. 9 DCCV of AF in pregnant individuals is safe for both mother and fetus and should be performed within 48 hours of presentation to minimize risk of stroke. 1 Appropriate sedation should be provided to the preg- nant individuals before DCCV. Fetal monitoring is generally used during and directly after DCCV. 2. Antiarrhythmic drugs are used in pregnancy for both maternal and fetal conditions; therefore, their mecha- nisms and adverse effect pro ﬁle must be tolerable to both mother and fetus. These medications should be avoided if possible during the ﬁrst trimester, and initiation of the drug should be attempted at the lowest dose with involvement of an electrophysiologist or cardiologist skilled in the management of arrhythmias in pregnancy. 10 Intravenous ibutilide has been used effectively in pregnant women with refractory AF, although published reports included a very small number of patients. In a pregnant patient presenting with AF and manifest preexcitation, intravenous pro- cainamide is also an option. 11 3. In pregnant individuals with structurally normal hearts and AF, rhythm-control strategies may include agents with a long record of safety (eg,ﬂecainide and sotalol) with appropriate monitoring that includes surveillance ECGs. 1,12 Amiodarone is generally avoided and reserved for life-threatening arrhythmias because of potential toxicities to the fetus, including goiter, neu- rodevelopmental abnormalit ies, bradycardia, delayed growth, and premature birth. 10,12 4. In pregnant individuals with persistent AF, rate- control strategies may include beta blockers with long record of safety in pregnancy (propranolol, metoprolol) or digoxin. Atenolol is generally avoided in pregnancy due to concerns about intrauterine growth retardation. Serum digoxin levels may be unreliable in pregnancy as digoxin-like immunoreactive substances are increased in pregnant individuals and react with anti- bodies against digoxin, interfering with the radioassay used for detection of digoxin serum levels. 13 5. Tools available to predict stroke risk in AF have not been validated in pregnancy. In the rare case of AF with no risk factors or signs of heart disease, anti- coagulation may not be necessary. 1,14 SDM should be used when considering anticoagulation during preg- nancy (Table 28). Some patients may be deemed at high risk for stroke, such as those with mitral stenosis, for which recommendations for anticoagulation in preg- nancy are extrapolated from experience in managing VHD.

In patients with cancer and AF, multidisciplinary communication including cardiology, oncology and other clinicians, and SDM with the patient is recommendedto optimize cancer and AF treatment and to reduce the risk of drug-drug interactions, QTc prolongation, proarrhythmia, bleeding, and thromboembolism. 1-3 2a C-LD 2. In patients who are to be initiated on cancer therapies associated with an increased risk of developing AF, increased vigilance for incident AF and treatment of contributing factors is reasonable to decrease morbidity. 1,4-6 2a B-NR 3. In most patients with AF and cancer (remote history or receiving active cancer treatment), DOACs are reasonable to choose over VKAs for stroke risk reduction.7,8 Synopsis Patients with cancer have an increased risk of AF. A Danish nationwide study observed an incident AF rate of 17.4 per 1,000 person-years compared with 3.7 per 1,000 person-years in patients without cancer. 9 A meta-analysis of observational studies demonstrated the risk of AF to be w47% higher in patients with cancer compared with pa- tients without cancer.5,10 The increased risk of AF is likely related to increased age, shared risk factors between cancer and CVD (eg, obesity and systemic inﬂammation), coexistent comorbidities (eg, hypertension and HF), car- diac involvement by the tumor, as well as certain medical therapeutics ( Table 29 ), oncologic surgery, especially thoracic, and thoracic radiation therapy. 11,12 New-onset AF in patients with cancer is associated with a higher risk of HF, thromboembolism, bleeding, and mortality. 13-15 Notably, Bruton ’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, such as ibrutinib, which are used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoprolifera tive malignancies and often u s e df o ra ne x t e n d e dp e r i o do ft i m e ,a r ea s s o c i a t e dw i t ha higher risk of AF due to off-target cardiac effects. 16 In 1 meta-analysis, the risk of AF with use of ibrutinib was 4 times higher compared with that without use of ibrutinib. 17 Although patients with cancer are underrepresented in the major trials comparing DOACs to VKAs, large obser- vational studies and meta-analyses of studies of patients with cancer and AF have demonstrated similar or lower rates of ischemic stroke and bleeding in patients taking D O A C sc o m p a r e dw i t hw a r f a r i n . 7,8 Patients with AF and cancer are at an increased risk for major bleeding.18 They also are commonly on antineo plastic agents, which may have important drug interactions with OACs.19 Thus, these factors should be carefully considered in determining indication and choice of OAC. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In patients with cancer who develop AF in the presence of cancer therapeutics associated with an increased risk of incident AF ( Table 29 ), the ﬁrst approach usually consists of optimizing AF control while continuing cancer therapy. However, if AF control cannot be ach- ieved, decisions regarding dose reduction of the cancer therapy or even stoppage can only be made in concert with the oncology team and SDM with the patient. Drug-drug interactions between cancer, antiar- rhythmic, rate-control, and anticoagulant therapies are common and require close attention. 1 For example, in the case of BTK inhibitors, CYP3A inhibitors such as amiodarone, dronedarone, verapamil, and diltiazem are usually avoided, due to the associated risk of elevation in ibrutinib levels. 1 Further, ibrutinib can raise levels of digoxin, a P-glycoprotein substrate. 1 Therefore, beta blockers are considered the best option for rate control in BTK inhibitor-associated AF. If additional agents are needed for AF control, any concomitant reduction in dose of ibrutinib is guided by oncology. 1 Further, QTc prolongation, which is more common in patients with cancer due to several cancer therapies, anti- emetics, antibiotics, and electrolyte derangements, can be further exacerbated by QT-prolonging antiar- rhythmic agents. 3 Structured screening by pharmacists for potential drug-drug interactions could provide beneﬁt. 2 Joglar et al JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 230 2. Certain medical cancer therapies can increase the risk of incident AF (Table 29). Patients with cancer and AF are older and have higher rates of hypertension, MI, a n dH Fc o m p a r e dw i t ht h o s ew h od on o td e v e l o p AF. 13-15 The development of perioperative AF has been strongly associated with perioperative complications. 20 In general, patients with cancer and CVD may be undertreated with GDMT or less often referred to spe- cialists for cardiovascular care. 21 Optimization of car- diovascular conditions such as hypertension and HF may decrease the risk of incident AF, AF recurrence, and of major adverse cardiovascular events, including stroke. 22-25 Therefore, in patients without a history of AF, or those with previous history of AF, who are to be started on cancer therapies associated with a higher risk of AF, evaluation and optimization of cardiovas- cular risk factors or disease by a cardiologist could be beneﬁcial in decreasing incident and recurrent AF and associated cardiovascular events, although no data are available speci ﬁcally in patients with cancer. Further- more, elevated natriuret ic peptides or a history of previous AF can identify patients at higher risk of AF after major thoracic cancer surgery. 26,27 3. No large RCTs are available that compare DOACs to warfarin in patients with AF and cancer. A meta- analysis of post-hoc analyses of RCTs and retrospec- tive observational studies that compared DOACs with warfarin in patients with AF and cancer (n ¼229,221) demonstrated a lower risk of stroke or systemic em- bolism (RR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.52-0.81]; P¼0.001) and major bleeding (RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.50-0.92]; P¼0.01) with DOACs. 8 This meta-analysis included post hoc analyses of patients wi t hc a n c e ra n dA Ff r o mt h e ROCKET AF (rivaroxaban versus warfarin), ENGAGE TIMI-48 (edoxaban versus warfarin), and ARISTOTLE (apixaban versus warfarin) trials. These ﬁndings were consistent in patients deﬁned as having active cancer, although de ﬁnitions of active cancer varied by study. An additional large retrosp ective observation study comparing DOACs to warfarin in patients with active cancer demonstrated a lower risk of the composite endpoint of ischemic stroke/intracranial bleeding in patients taking DOACs compared with VKA (adjusted HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.48-0.88]). 7 Although most of the data in this patient population came from retrospective observational studies that may be prone to selection TABLE 29 Medical Cancer Therapy Associated With Increased Risk of AF ( >1%) Cancer Therapy Frequency Reported in Clinical Trials and Observational Studies Comments Common: Incidence 1%-10% Frequent: >10% Anthracyclines Doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone X AF may be a secondary result of anthracycline cardiotoxicity; studies in different populations demonstrate variable risk of AF Antimetabolites Clofarabine combined with cytarabine 5FU Cepecitabine Gemcitabine X X X X Alkylating agents Cyclophosphamide Melphalan þ stem cell transplantation X X* *Stem cell transplantation is associated with an increased risk of AF,28,29 and the risk may be higher with melphalan-associated regimens.

Special consideration should be given to patient bleeding risk and antineo- plastic drug interactions in this patient population (Table 30). 18,19 10.15. CKD and Kidney Failure CKD and kidney failure (formerly end-stage renal disease) share common risk factors with AF, such as hypertension and diabetes, and unsurprisingly, CKD and AF are asso- ciated in a disproportionate manner. In population studies, baseline serum creatinine, eGFR, and proteinuria were strongly associated with incident of AF during follow-up. 1,2 AF at baseline also predicted new renal dysfunction or proteinuria, suggesting a bidirectional relationship between CKD and AF. 2 In an insurance database of 206,229 adults with con ﬁrmed CKD, over a mean follow-up of 5 years, there was a 67% increased rate of kidney failure among patients with CKD who devel- oped incident AF compared with those without AF, even after adjustment for baseline factors. 3 Data on the man- agement of AF in patients with CKD is limited because the major trials of rate control, rhythm control, and catheter ablation have generally not reported eGFR or CKD as a baseline variable or excluded such patients. Antiar- rhythmic drug doses are adjusted based on pharmacoki- netic data and clinical experience, with amiodarone being t h eo n l yd r u gt h a td o e sn o tr e q u i r ed o s ea d j u s t m e n ti n patients with CKD or those receiving dialysis.

COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 2a B-NR 1. For patients with AF who are at increased risk of systemic thromboembolism and mild or moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh * class A or B), OAC therapy is reasonable in the absence of clinically signiﬁcant liver disease –induced coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia. 1-7 2a B-NR 2. For patients with AF who are at increased risk of systemic thromboembolism and mild or moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh class A or B) and who are deemed to be candidates for anticoagulation, it is reasonable to prescribe DOACs (Child-Pugh class A: any DOAC; Child-Pugh class B: apixaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban) over warfarin.1,7-11 3: Harm C-LD 3. For patients with AF and moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh class B) at increased risk of systemic thromboembolism, rivaroxaban is contraindicated d ue to the potentially increased risk of bleeding.12 *Child-Pugh scoring: the severity of liver disease, primarily cirrhosis in patients with diagnosed liver disease. Child-Pugh A (mild): 5-6 points;Child-Pugh B (moderate): 7-9 points; Child-Pugh C (severe): 10-15 points. The score is based on the 5 variables: encephalopathy (none¼1 point, grade 1 and 2¼2 points, grade 3 and 4¼ 3 points); ascites (none¼1 point, slight¼2 points, moderate¼3 points); total bilirubin (<2 mg/mL¼1 point, 2-3 mg/mL¼2 points,>3 mg/mL¼3 points); albumin (>3.5 mg/mL¼1 point, 2.8-3.5 mg/mL¼2 points,<2.8 mg/mL¼3 points); INR (<1.7¼1 point, INR 1.7-2.2¼2 points, INR>2.2¼3 points). Synopsis No RCT has evaluated the use of OACs in patients with AF and liver disease. Three observational studies and 1 meta-analysis of observational studies have compared OAC therapy with no OAC therapy in patients with AF and active liver disease or a history of liver disease. 1-4 In addition, 3 observational studies have compared OAC therapy in patients with liver disease to those without liver disease. 5-7 In general, anticoagulation has been associated with lower risks of ischemic stroke or throm- boembolism but was also associated with a signi ﬁcantly higher risk of major bleedingo rI C Hc o m p a r e dw i t hn oo r a l anticoagulation therapy in patients with AF and liver disease. Oral factor Xa inhibitors undergo hepatic meta- bolism, and impaired liver function may increase their plasma concentrations and the risk of bleeding.

Four postmarketing retrospective studies and 2 meta-analyses have evaluated the comparison be- tween DOACs and VKAs in this population, and they showed DOACs were associated with a lower risk of major bleeding or ICH. 1,7-11 Limited data exist on the safety of DOAC in severe liver disease. The uses of DOACs based on a Child-Pugh Score are summarized in Table 13 (Section 6.3.1.1 . “Considerations in Managing Anticoagulation ”). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. A meta-analysis showed that VKA use was signiﬁcantly associated with lower risks of ischemic stroke or thromboembolism but was also associated with signif- icantly higher risks of major bleeding or ICH in patients w i t hA Fa n dl i v e rd i s e a s ec o m p a r e dw i t hn oo r a la n t i - coagulation therapy. 7 A large-scale retrospective study also corroborated that OAC use was signiﬁcantly asso- ciated with a lower risk of stroke or all-cause mortality in patients with AF and cirrhosis. 3 VKA use in the liver ﬁbrosis group was associated with a higher risk of the composite cardiovascular events and major bleeding than in the nonliver ﬁbrosis group. 4 However, no sig- niﬁcant difference in the co mposite cardiovascular events and major bleeding between the 2 groups receiving DOACs was found. The efﬁcacy and safety of VKAs or DOACs were not affected by nonalcohol fatty liver disease status. 5 The subgroup analysis of the meta-analysis found that the risk of major bleeding was not affected by the presence of esophageal varices.13 2. A meta-analysis found no signiﬁcant difference in the risk of ischemic stroke and thromboembolism between DOACs and VKAs (OR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.36-1.88];P¼0.64) in patients with almost exclusively mild-to-moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh class A-B), but DOAC use was associated with lower risks of major bleeding (OR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.38-0.75]; P¼0.0003) and ICH (OR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.23-0.53]; P<0.0001) compared with the warfarin group. 7 Another meta-analysis showed that, in patients with exclusively mild-to-moderate cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score A-B), DOAC use was associated with lower risks of ischemic stroke (HR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.10- 0.90]), major bleeding (HR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.57-0.72]), or ICH (HR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.40-0.59]) compared with warfarin. 11 DOACs are reasonable oral anticoagulation agents in patients with AF and mild-to-moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh class A-B). However, data on DOACs are lacking on patients with AF and severe liver disease (Child-Pugh class C). 3. Rivaroxaban is currently avoided in patients with moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh class B). Rivarox- aban AUC signi ﬁcantly increased by 2.27-fold after a single dose of rivaroxaban 10 mg in patients with moderate liver disease compared with healthy sub- jects. 12 Although the FDA labeling recommends avoid- ing edoxaban in patients with moderate liver disease due to the concern of underlying coagulopathy, the edoxaban AUC was not signiﬁcantly increased after a single dose of edoxaban 15 mg in patients with mod- erate liver disease compared with healthy subjects. 14 Apixaban AUC was not signi ﬁcantly increased after a single dose of apixaban 5 mg in subjects with mild and moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh class A and B) c o m p a r e dw i t hh e a l t h ys u b j e c t s . 15 Dabigatran AUC was also not signi ﬁcantly different after a single dose of dabigatran 150 mg in patients with moderate liver disease (Child-Pugh class B) compared with that in healthy subjects. 16 11. FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS Enormous progress and important advances have been made in recent years on the understanding of mecha- nisms and on the prevention and management of AF, including substantial progre ss since the 2014 guideline, as well as the 2019 focused update. Although the writing committee has tried to make signiﬁcant progress in this current guideline to address many of the gaps in the clinical management of AF, important gaps in knowledge remain and are listed below. 1. AF as a disease continuum: AF must be seen as a disease continuum, yet historically the emphasis has been on rhythm management. More evidence is needed on how to best improve in other aspects of AF care, such as prevention, modiﬁcation of risk factors, and how to incorporate holistic approaches to AF management into daily clinical practice. 2. Downstream consequences: The downstream conse- quences of AF over the long term must be better studied and deﬁned. Most studies generally focus on short-term effects of therapy, usually 6 to 12 months. Many long-term consequences of AF remain poorly characterized, such as dementia and valvular insuf ﬁciency. 3. Better goal and outcome de ﬁnition: Historically, ablation failure has been deﬁned as having 30 seconds of AF identiﬁed during a follow-up period. However, that number might be too simplistic because AF burden may be a more important metric and because the 30-second metric might not re ﬂect signi ﬁcant burden reduction that may be observed in many pa- tients. Patient-oriented o utcomes would also be more important, such as QOL. 4. Role of risk modiﬁers in AF stroke prevention:Great variation exists in risk of stroke depending on JACC VOL. 83, NO. 1, 2024 Joglar et al JANUARY 2/9, 2024:109 – 279 2023 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 233 nonbinary or dynamic risk factors. Yet it is unclear how to best manage patients accordingly. For example, how should risk of stroke be assessed in a person with hypertension in whom the BP is very well controlled? Or, perhaps, how do we incorporate AF burden on the risk calculation? 5. Individualization of AF and stroke risk: Although some studies have demonstrated an effective role of biomarkers in predicting AF and stroke, how to incorporate these ﬁndings into clinical practice re- mains elusive. Similarly, how to incorporate other clinical markers of atrial c ardiopathy into clinical practice must be better deﬁned, as well as clariﬁcation as to how these nontraditional risk factors help better stratify patient risk. 6. Incorporating other stroke risk scores: The ubiqui- tous nature and simplicity of the CHA 2DS2-VASc score have diminished with consideration of other scores of potential utility, better c-statistics, and with potential advantages in particular populations. Additional studies are needed to bettertake advantage of scores for speci ﬁc groups, scores that could potentially be incorporated into the electronic medical record, and perhaps some with the potential bene ﬁto fb e t t e r discriminating the true low-risk patients. 7. Surgical exclusion and LAAO: Increasingly available evidence has demonstrated the bene ﬁto fs u r g i c a l LAA exclusion for stroke prevention, but the most scienti ﬁcally rigorous trials included patients who received concomitant anticoagulation. More evidence is needed on the magnitude of beneﬁto fL A Ae x c l u - sion in preventing stroke in patients who have con- traindications to anticoagulation and how to best manage those patients around rhythm-control in- terventions, such as cardio version. Clinicians would also like to see additional data on pLAAO, particularly peri-implant stroke manag ement and longer-term outcomes in patients in whom periprocedure anti- coagulation is not possible. 8. Subclinical AF: What magnitude of AF burden man- dates stroke prevention therapy in patients with subclinical AF must be better deﬁned. Certainly, large general risk categories have been identi ﬁed, and general guidelines exist, but extensive practice vari- ations remain, and more precise recommendations for t h ec o m m u n i t ya r en e e d e d .I na d d i t i o n ,t h er o l ea n d impact on outcomes of AF screening in general and poststroke should be better deﬁned. 9. Use and applicability of consumer-based wearable heart monitoring devices: These devices are now widespread and are used to diagnose and monitor response to therapy in patients with AF. Validation on the accuracy of the most common available technol- ogies is needed. How to best use these devices in practice, including for AF screening, must be better deﬁned. 10. Standardization of ablation procedures: Great prac- tice variation exists on how AF ablation procedures are performed, either as ﬁrst or repeat procedures. Large registries and more data are required to better deﬁne standards of care in this ﬁeld. Many in- terventions, such as extra ablation lines, are still performed despite limited data demonstrating ef ﬁ- cacy, whereas the best approaches to persistent AF and repeat ablation are poorly deﬁned. 11. Candidates for ablation: We must better identify clinical markers to better identify when catheter ablation is unlikely to bene ﬁt patients and de ﬁne speci ﬁc criteria for candidacy forﬁrst time and repeat procedures. 12. Artiﬁcial intelligence for AF management: Artiﬁcial intelligence could potenti ally be used to better tailor therapy to the individual patient, taking into consid- eration numerous factors that may better select can- didates for therapeutic approaches, such as anticoagulation versus LAAO, rhythm versus rate control, catheter ablation versus medical therapy, modiﬁcation of risk factors, genetics, and others. 13. Strategies for anticoagulation: Ongoing clinical trials are assessing different strategies for oral anti- coagulation in persons who have undergone catheter ablation, including the OCEAN (Optimal Anti- Coagulation for Enhanced-Risk Patients Post- Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation) trial (NCT02168829) 1 and ODIn-AF (Prevention of Silent Cerebral Thromboembolism by Oral Anticoagulation With Dabigatran After Pulmonary Vein Isolation for Atrial Fibrillation) (NCT02067182) 2 trial, because it is unclear in whom anticoagulation can be dis- continued after successful ablation. Several studies also have investigated the use of intermittent or continuous rhythm monitoring to guide oral anti- coagulation in persons with AF, including those who have undergone ablation. 3,4 These so-called “PITP” or “electrocardiographic-guided ” approaches are investigational. Ongoing clinical trials like REACT-AF (Rhythm Evaluation for Anticoagulation Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation) will help determine whether they are suitable for clinical practice. Also, anti- coagulation/DOAC use in pregnancy needs to be investigated because it is currently contraindicated in view of lack of data on safety.

Sleep: A m o n gp a t i e n t sw i t hA Fa n dS D B ,t h ei m p a c t of treatment of SDB on maintenance of sinus rhythm and on general cardiovascular outcomes remains uncertain. Most studies have been observational, which introduces confounding factors. Once diag- nosed, the adherence to treatment for SDB is also suboptimal. 15. SDM and decision aids:Decision aids are perceived as important tools to better inform patients about options for AF management; yet, it is unclear if those tools improve clinical outcomes. Most decision aids devel- oped for AF focus on anticoagulation; there is a paucity of validated decision aids, including for AF rhythm management using antiarrhythmic drugs or ablation. 16. Genetic testing: The use and applicability of consumer-based or targeted genetic testing for AF remains uncertain. Polygen ic risk scores can indicate higher risk for AF, but the use of genetic testing to impact clinical surveillance, management, and clinical outcomes remains uncertain. 17. Race, ethnicity, gender, and sex differences: In sex- ual- and gender-diverse individuals, additional research is recommended to identify the incidence a n do u t c o m e so fA Fa sw e l la st h ei m p a c to fg e n d e r - afﬁrming therapies on arrhythmia incidence and outcomes. Additional data across racial and ethnic groups should also be encouraged. 18. Standardized measures: For patients with AF, a standardized measure might be useful to assess symptoms and/or QOL and impact of management strategies. 19. SDOH: The measurement and impact of SDOH in AF is underutilized and understudied. PRESIDENTS AND STAFF American College of Cardiology B. Hadley Wilson, MD, FACC, President Cathleen C.

ABSTRACT AIM The “2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP/NAEMSP/SCAI Guideline for the Management of Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes” incor- porates new evidence since the“2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction” and the corresponding “2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of Patients With Non–ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes” and the “2015 ACC/AHA/SCAI Focused Update on Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Patients With ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction.” The “2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP/NAEMSP/SCAI Guideline for the Management of Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes” and the“2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization” retire and replace, respectively, the“2016 ACC/AHA Guideline Focused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease.” METHODS A comprehensive literature search was conducted from July 2023 to April 2024. Clinical studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and other evidence conducted on human participants were identiﬁed that were published in English from MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. STRUCTURE Many recommendations from previously published guidelines have been updated with new evidence, and new rec- ommendations have been created when supported by published data.

Dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Ticagrelor or prasugrel is recommended in preference to clopidogrel in patients with ACS who are undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In patients with non –ST- segment elevation ACS who are scheduled for an invasive strategy with timing of angiography to be>24 hours, upstream treatment with clopidogrel or tica- grelor may be considered to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events. 2. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and an oral P2Y12 inhibitor is indicated for at least 12 months as the default strategy in patients with ACS who are not at high bleeding risk. Several strategies are available to reduce bleeding risk in patients with ACS who have undergone PCI and require antiplatelet therapy: (a) in patients at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, a proton pump inhibitor is recommended; (b) in patients who have tolerated dual antiplatelet therapy with tica- grelor, transition to ticagrelor monotherapy is recommended $1 month after PCI; or (c) in patients who require long-term anticoagulation, aspirin discontinuation is recomme nded 1 to 4 weeks after PCI with continued use of a P2Y12 inhibitor (preferably clopidogrel). 3. High-intensity statin th erapy is recommended for all patients with ACS, and with the option to initiate con- current ezetimibe. A nonstatin lipid-lowering agent (eg, ezetimibe, evolocumab, alirocumab, inclisiran, bem- pedoic acid) is recommended for patients already on maximally tolerated statin who have a low-density li- poprotein cholesterol level of $7 0m g / d L( 1 . 8m m o l / L ) . It is reasonable in this high-risk population to further intensify lipid-lowering t herapy if the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is 55 to <70 mg/dL (1.4 to <1.8 mmol/L) and patient is already on a maxi- mally tolerated statin. 4. In patients with non–ST-segment elevation ACS who are at intermediate or high risk of ischemic events, an invasive approach with the intent to proceed with revascularization is recommended during hospitaliza- tion to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events. In patients with non–ST-segment elevation ACS who are at low risk of ischemic events, a routine invasive or selective invasive approach with further risk strati ﬁ- cation is recommended to help identify those who may require revascularization and to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events. 5. Two procedural strategies are recommended in pa- tients with ACS who are undergoing PCI: (a) radial approach is preferred over femoral approach in pa- tients with ACS undergoing PCI to reduce bleeding, vascular complications, and death; and (b) intra- coronary imaging is recommended to guide PCI in pa- tients with ACS with complex coronary lesions. 6. A strategy of complete revascularization is recom- mended in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or non –ST-segment elevation A C S .T h ec h o i c eo fr e v a s c u l a r i z a t i o nm e t h o d( i e ,c o r - onary artery bypass graft surgery versus multivessel PCI) in non–ST-segment elevation ACS and multivessel disease should be based on the complexity of the cor- onary artery disease and comorbid conditions. PCI of signi ﬁcant nonculprit stenoses for patients with ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction can be per- formed in a single procedure or staged with some Rao et al JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2138 preference toward performing multivessel PCI in a single procedure. In patients with ACS and cardiogenic shock, emergency revascularization of the culprit vessel is indicated; however,r o u t i n eP C Io fn o n i n f a r c t - related arteries at the time of PCI is not recommended. 7. Based on one trial, use of the microaxialﬂow pump in selected patients with cardiogenic shock related to acute myocardial infarction is reasonable to reduce death. However, complications such as bleeding, limb ischemia, and renal failure are higher with the micro- axial ﬂow pump compared with usual care. Therefore, careful attention to vascular access and weaning of support is important to appropriately balance the beneﬁts and risks. 8.

After discharge, focus on secondary prevention is fundamental. A fasting lipid panel is recommended 4 to 8 weeks after initiating or adjusting the dose of lipid-lowering therapy. Referral to cardiac rehabilita- tion is also recommended, with the option for home- based programs for patients unable or unwilling to attend in person. PREAMBLE Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated scien- tiﬁc evidence into clinical practice guidelines with rec- ommendations to improve cardiovascular health. These guidelines, which are based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a foundation for the delivery of quality cardiovascular care. The ACC and AHA sponsor the development and publication of clinical practice guidelines without commercial support, and members volunteer their time to the writing and review efforts. Guidelines are ofﬁcial policy of the ACC and AHA. For some guidelines, the ACC and AHA collaborate with other organizations. Intended Use Clinical practice guidelin es provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing car- diovascular disease (CVD). The focus is on medical prac- tice in the United States, but these guidelines are relevant to patients throughout the world. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients ’ interests. Guidelines are intended to de ﬁne practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances and sh ould not replace clinical judgment. Clinical Implementation Management, in accordance with guideline recommen- dations, is effective only when followed by both practi- tioners and patients. Adherence to recommendations can be enhanced by shared decision-making between clini- cians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, prefer- ences, and associated conditions and comorbidities. Methodology and Modernization The ACC/AHA Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines (Joint Committee) continuously reviews, up- dates, and modiﬁes guideline methodology on the basis of published standards from or ganizations, including the National Academy of Medicin e (formerly the Institute of Medicine), 1 and on the basis of internal reevaluation. Similarly, presentation an d delivery of guidelines are reevaluated and modi ﬁed in response to evolving tech- nologies and other factors to optimally facilitate dissem- ination of information to health care professionals at the point of care. Numerous modi ﬁcations to the guidelines have been implemented to make them shorter and enhance “user friendliness. ” Guidelines are written and presented in a modular, “knowledge chunk” format in which each chunk includes a table of recommendations, a brief synopsis, recommendation-speci ﬁc supportive text, and, when appropriate, ﬂow diagrams or additional tables. Hyper- linked references are provided for each modular knowl- edge chunk to facilitate quick access and review. In recognition of the importance of cost–value consid- erations, in certain guidelines, when appropriate and feasible, an assessment of value for a drug, device, or intervention may be performed in accordance with the ACC/AHA methodology. 2 To ensure that guideline recommendations remain current, new data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the writing committee and sta ff. When applicable, rec- ommendations will be updated with new evidence, or new recommendations will be created when supported by published evidence-based data. Going forward, targeted sections/knowledge chunks will be revised dynamically after publication and timely peer review of potentially practice-changing science. The previous designations of JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 Rao et al JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline 2139 “full revision ” and “focused update ” have been phased out. For additional information and policies on guideline development, readers may consult the ACC/AHA guide- line methodology manual 3 and other methodology arti- cles. 4-6 Selection of Writing Committee Members The Joint Committee strives to ensure that the guideline writing committee contains requisite content expertise and is representative of the broader cardiovascular com- munity by selection of experts across a spectrum of backgrounds, representing different geographic regions, sexes, races, ethnicities, intellectual perspectives/biases, and clinical practice settings. Organizations and profes- sional societies with related interests and expertise are invited to participate as collaborators. Relationships With Industry and Other Entities The ACC and AHA have rigorous policies and methods to ensure that documents are developed without bias or improper inﬂuence. The complete policy on relationships with industry and other entities (RWI) can be found at https://www.acc.org/guidelin es/about-guidelines-and- clinical-documents/relations hips-with-industry-policy . Appendix 1 of the guideline lists writing committee members ’ comprehensive and relevant RWI; for the pur- poses of full transparency, comprehensive and relevant disclosure information for the Joint Committee is also available at https://www.acc.org/ guidelines/about- guidelines-and-clinical-documents/guidelines-and-documents- task-forces. Evidence Review and Evidence Review Committees In developing recommendati ons, the writing committee uses evidence-based methodologies that are based on all available data. 3,4 Literature searches focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include registries, non- randomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. Only key references are cited. An independent evidence review committee is commissioned when there are $1 questions deemed of utmost clinical importance and merit formal systematic review to determine which patients are most likely to beneﬁt from a drug, device, or treatment strategy, and to what degree. Criteria for commissioning an evidence review committee and formal systematic review include absence of a current authoritative systematic review, feasibility of deﬁning the beneﬁt and risk in a time frame consistent with the writing of a guideline, relevance to a substantial number of patients, and likelihood that the ﬁndings can be translated into actionable recommenda- tions. Evidence review committee members may include methodologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and bio- statisticians. Recommendati ons developed by the writing committee on the basis of the systematic review are marked “ SR”. Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy The term guideline-directed medical therapy encom- passes clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, and both pharmacological and procedural treatments. For these and all recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader should con ﬁrm dosage with product insert material and evaluate for contraindications and in- teractions. Recommendations are limited to drugs, devices, and treatments appr oved for clinical use in the United States.

Methodology and Evidence Review The recommendations listed in this guideline are, when- ever possible, evidence based. An initial extensive evi- dence review — which included literature derived from research involving human subjects, published in English, and indexed in MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline — was conducted from July 2023 to April 2024. Key search words included but were not limited to the following: AHA/ACC Clinical Practice Guidelines; acute coronary syndrome(s); angina , unstable; anticoagulants; aspirin; atrial ﬁbrillation; cardiovascular diseases; coro- nary artery disease (CAD); coronary syndrome; emergency medical services; ﬁbrinolytic agents; hemorrhage; major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); morphine; myocardial infarction; non –ST-segment elevation Rao et al JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2140 myocardial infarction (NSTEMI); percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); prehospital; revascularization; risk; ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); time factors; treatment outcome. Additional relevant studies, which were published through April 2024 during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables when appropriate. The ﬁnal evi- dence tables summarize the evidence used by the writing committee to formulate recom mendations. References selected and published in the present document are representative and not all-inclusive. 1.2. Composition of the Writing Committee The writing committee consisted of general cardiologists, interventional cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons, critical care cardiologists, emergency physicians, cardiac imaging experts, advanced practice nurses, clinical phar- macists, and lay/patient representatives. The writing committee included representatives from the AHA, ACC, American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), Na- tional Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP), and So- ciety for Cardiovascular Angi ography and Interventions (SCAI). Appendix 1 of the current document lists writing committee members ’ comprehensive and relevant RWI. 1.3. Guideline Review and Approval The Joint Committee appointed a peer review committee to review the document. The peer review committee comprised individuals nominated by the ACC, AHA, and the collaborating orga nizations. Reviewers ’ RWI infor- mation was distributed to the writing committee and is published in this document (Appendix 2). This document was approved for publication by the governing bodies of the ACC and the AHA and was endorsed by ACEP, NAEMSP, and SCAI. 1.4. Scope of the Guideline The scope of the “2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP/NAEMSP/SCAI Guideline for the Management of Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes ” (referred to hereafter as the “2025 ACS guideline ”) is to incorporate new evidence since the publication of the “2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction, ” 1 the corresponding “2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Man- agement of Patients With Non–ST-Elevation Acute Coro- nary Syndromes, ”2 and the “2015 ACC/AHA/SCAI Focused Update on Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Patients With ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction. ” 3 The 2025 ACS guideline and the “2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization ”4 retire and replace, respectively, the “2016 ACC/AHA Guideline Focused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease.”5 This guideline primarily focuses on the management of type 1 acute myocardial infarction (AMI). It can be challenging to differentiate type 1 versus type 2 MI. In cases of uncer- tainty and depending on the bene ﬁts/risks of a speci ﬁc diagnostic or therapeutic intervention, it may be appro- priate to err on the side of considering an event a type 1 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event until established to be otherwise. In the United States, an estimated 805,000 AMIs occur annually of which 605,000 are ﬁrst MI events and 200,000 are recurrent. 6-8 Although signi ﬁcant morbidity a n dm o r t a l i t ya r ea s s o c i a t e dw i t hM I ,3 0 - d a ya n di n - hospital mortality rates after STEMI have declined in part as a result of timely reperfusion and implementation of evidence-based secondary preven- tion. 9 From 2011 to 2021 in the United States, the annual death rate attributable to coronary heart disease declined by 15.0%. 6 The economic impact of MI is also substantial, with the total annual cost estimated at $84.9 billion, including direct medical expe nditures and indirect lost productivity and wages. 10,11 The incidence of MI is higher among Black males compared with non-Hispanic White males for reasons that are believed to be multi- factorial. 12,13 Potential factors th at may contribute to this disparity include a higher prevalence of risk factors for CAD, less use of guideline-recommended medica- tions post-MI, and socioeconomic factors. 14-19 In addi- tion to racial disparities, there are sex-related disparities in the prevalence, presentation, treatment, and outcomes of ACS even after adjusting for con- founding factors such as income, geography, and edu- cation. 20 W o m e nt e n dt op r e s e n tw i t hA C So na v e r a g e 10 years later than men and with a greater burden of CVD risk factors. Although chest pain remains the most common symptom of AMI, women are more likely than men to present with accompanying non –chest pain symptoms. 21-24 A delay in recognition of these symp- toms can result in delays in presentation, diagnosis, and timely treatment of women with ACS. Studies have also shown that women presenting with ACS are less likely to be correctly diagnosed with an ACS, receive guideline-directed medical therapy, 25-27 and/or undergo coronary revascularization when indicated. 28,29 Bridging these racial and sex gaps will require continued pro- vider education, better understanding of barriers to accessing quality care and guideline-directed medical therapy, and changes at the community and legislative level to address social dete rminants of health such as income, employment status, neighborhood safety, and access to healthy foods.

Table 1 contains a list of these publications deemed pertinent to this writing effort. It is intended for use as a resource, obviating the need to repeat existing guideline recommendations. Some recommendations have been carried forward from previously published guidelines. If unchanged, those recommendations remain current. Any changes to the formatting or content of these recommendations are deﬁned as: n Modiﬁed: formatting changes (eg, minor verbiage modiﬁcations such as PICO[TS] structure) n Adapted: substantive changes (eg, major adaptations, such as a change in Class of Recommendation [COR], Level of Evidence [LOE], drug, or device classiﬁcation). Changes are depicted in a footnote below the recom- mendation tables. 1.5. Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence The COR indicates the strength of recommendation, encompassing the estimated magnitude and certainty of beneﬁt in proportion to risk. The LOE rates the quality of scienti ﬁc evidence supporting the intervention on the basis of the type, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other sources (Table 2). 1 TABLE 1 Associated Publications Title Organization Publication Year (Reference) Guidelines Management of blood cholesterol AHA/ACC/AACVPR/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/ APhA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 201830 Prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults ACC/AHA/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/AGS/APhA/ASH/ ASPC/NMA/PCNA 201831 Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease ACC/AHA 2019 32 Coronary artery revascularization ACC/AHA/SCAI 2021 4 Evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain AHA/ACC/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 33 Prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack AHA/ASA 2021 34 Management of heart failure AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 35 Management of patients with chronic coronary disease AHA/ACC/ACCP/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 36 Diagnosis and management of atrialﬁbrillation ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS 2023 37 Other Relevant Documents Home-based cardiac rehabilitation AHA/ACC/AACVPR 2019 38 Classiﬁcation of cardiogenic shock SCAI, endorsed by ACC/AHA/SCCM/STS 2019 39 Contemporary diagnosis and management of patients with myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease AHA 2019 40 Invasive management of acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock AHA 2021 41 Mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction AHA 2021 42 SHOCK stage classiﬁcation update SCAI, endorsed by ACC/ACEP/AHA/ESC/ACVC/ ISHLT/ SCCM/STS 202143 Management of patients at risk for and with left ventricular thrombus AHA 2022 44 Cardiac catheterization laboratory management of the comatose adult patient with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest AHA 2024 45 AACVPR indicates American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation; AAPA, American Academy of Physician Associates (formerlyAmerican Academy of Physician Assistants); ABC, Association of Black Cardiologists; ACC, American College of Cardiology; ACCP, American College of Clinical Pharmacy; ACEP, American College of Emergency Physicians; ACPM, American College of Preventive Medicine; ACVC, Association for Acute Cardiovascular Care; ADA, American Diabetes Association;AGS, American Geriatrics Society; AHA, American Heart Association; APhA, American Pharmacists Association; ASA, American Stroke Association; ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; ASE, American Society of Echocardiography; ASH, American Society of Hypertension; ASPC, American Society for Preventive Cardiology; CHEST, American College of Chest Physicians; ESC, European Society of Cardiology; HFSA, Heart Failure Society of America; HRS, Heart Rhythm Society; ISHLT, International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation; NLA, National Lipid Association; NMA, National Medical Association; PCNA, Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association; SAEM, Society for Academic Emergency Medicine; SCAI, Societyfor Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions; SCCM, Society of Critical Care Medicine; SCCT, Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography; SCMR, Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance; SHOCK, Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock trial; and STS, Society of Thoracic Surgery.

Abbreviations 2. OVERVIEW OF ACS 2.1. Deﬁnition and Classiﬁcation of ACS ACS are typically caused by th e disruption (rupture or erosion) of an unstable corona ry artery atherosclerotic plaque with associated partial or complete coronary ar- tery thrombosis and/or microemboli, resulting in dimin- ished blood ﬂow to the myocardium and subsequent myocardial ischemia ( Figure 1). 1,2 ACS includes 3 related clinical conditions that exist along a continuum of severity: (1) unstable angina, (2) non –ST-segment eleva- tion myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and (3) STEMI. The initial diagnosis and classiﬁcation of ACS should be based on the clinical history and symptomatology, interpreta- tion of the ECG ( Table 3 ), and assessment of cardiac troponin (cTn). Unstable angina is de ﬁned by transient myocardial ischemia leading to diminished ﬂow in the absence of signi ﬁcant myonecrosis detected by circu- lating troponin. In contrast,patients with more prolonged or severe myocardial ischemia are diagnosed with MI and have elevated biomarkers of myonecrosis. Patients with NSTEMI may have a partially occluded coronary artery leading to subendocardial ischemia, while those with STEMI typically have a completely occluded vessel lead- ing to transmural myocardia li s c h e m i aa n di n f a r c t i o n (Figure 2). 3,4 The pathophysiology of ACS can be dynamic and thus patients can rapidly progress from one clinical condition (eg, unstable angina, NSTEMI, STEMI) to another during the course of their presentation and initial evaluation and treatment. Other, less common causes of myocardial ischemia, among others, include coronary ar- tery spasm, embolism, and dissection. 3 This guideline will focus on the acute management of ACS, including unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI, which are presumed to result from atherosclerotic plaque rupture or plaque erosion and subsequent thrombosis. 4 Under the Universal De ﬁnition of MI, these MI events would be classi ﬁed as type 1 MI events (Table 4).4 The diagnostic evaluation of chest pain and the management of type 2 MI, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, and MINOCA (MI with nonobstructive coronary artery disease) are covered in separate documents. 5-8 Ad e t a i l e d description of the approach to the evaluation of patients with chest pain can be found in the 2021 AHA/ACC/ASE/ CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR Chest Pain Guideline. 5 Abbreviation Meaning/Phrase ACEi angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ACS acute coronary syndromes AF atrial ﬁbrillation AMI acute myocardial infarction ARB angiotensin receptor blocker ASCVD atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease CABG coronary artery bypass grafting CAD coronary artery disease CCD chronic coronary disease CDP clinical decision pathway CICU cardiac intensive care unit CR cardiac rehabilitation cTn cardiac troponin CVD cardiovascular disease DAPT dual antiplatelet therapy DOAC direct oral anticoagulant ECG electrocardiogram FDA U.S. Food and Drug Administration FFR fractional ﬂow reserve FMC ﬁrst medical contact GLP-1 glucagon-like peptide-1 HF heart failure hs-cTn high-sensitivity cardiac troponin IABP intra-aortic balloon pump ICD implantable cardioverter-de ﬁbrillator IVUS intravascular ultrasound LDL low-density lipoprotein LDL-C low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LV left ventricular LVEF left ventricular ejection fraction MACE major adverse cardiovascular event MCS mechanical circulatory support MI myocardial infarction MINOCA MI with nonobstructive coronary artery disease MVD multivessel disease NSTE-ACS non –ST-segment elevation ACS NSTEMI non –ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction OCT optical coherence tomography OR odds ratio PCI percutaneous coronary intervention PCSK9 proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 PPCI primary percutaneous coronary intervention PPI proton pump inhibitor QOL quality of life RCT randomized controlled trial ROSC return of spontaneous circulation (continued in the next column) Abbreviation Meaning/Phrase SGLT-2 sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 STEMI ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction UFH unfractionated heparin VA-ECMO venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation Rao et al JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2144 Progressive lipid accumulation and in ﬂammation within an atherosclerotic plaque may lead to plaque instability. 1 Rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque and exposure of plaque contents to the circulation may then culminate in activation of the coagulation cascade and subsequent thrombosis. The presence of thrombus may compromise ﬂow to the myocardium, leading to myocar- dial ischemia and eventual myonecrosis. Since early initiation of therapy is imperative for patients with ACS, a high index of suspicion is warranted for those who pre- sent with signs and symptoms that could be consistent with myocardial ischemia. Patients with ACS are at the highest risk for cardio- vascular complications acutely, including prior to hos- pital presentation and during the early hospital phase. With appropriate management, this risk begins to attenuate; however, patients remain at increased risk of recurrent cardiovascular events for several months to years after an ACS. 9 This may in part be related to the acute inﬂammatory milieu that exists after ACS that may contribute to a heightened risk of recurrent events. Although the point at which a patient transitions from being a patient with an acute ACS to one with more stable or chronic coronary disease (CCD) is incompletely deﬁned, many of the medications indicated at discharge in patients with an ACS are similar to those for the management of a patient with CCD and should be extended more than a year beyond ACS. The long-term management of patients with ACS who are presumed to now have more stable coronary disease has been described in the 2023 AHA/ ACC/ACCP/ASPC/NLA/PCNA Chronic Coronary Disease Guideline. 10 FIGURE 1 Pathobiology of a Type 1 Myocardial Infarction Due to Atherosclerotic Plaque Disruption Progressive lipid accumulation and inﬂammation within an atherosclerotic plaque may lead to plaque instability. Rupture or erosion of the atherosclerotic plaque and exposure of plaque contents to the circulation may then culminate in activation of the coagulation cascade and subsequent thrombosis.

Speci ﬁcally, patients should be managed based on the presence or absence of ST- segment elevation (or suspected equivalent) on the 12- lead ECG ( Table 3 for STEMI electrocardiographic criteria). When possible, electrocardiographic tracings can be transmitted to the PPCI center while en route to help expedite coronary re perfusion upon arrival. Because patients with ACS and evidence of heart failure (HF), ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock in the prehospital setting are at highest risk for death, identi ﬁcation of these complications is important with subsequent triage of these patients to a PCI-capable facility when possible ( Section 8 , “Cardiogenic Shock Management ”). 14,15 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. The early acquisition and recording of prehospital 12- lead ECGs by trained personnel is associated with shorter reperfusion times and lower mortality rates from STEMI if this diagnostic information is integrated in patients ’ care. 1,2,16 Appropriately trained EMS personnel (ie, paramedics) can interpret 12-lead ECGs for the identi ﬁcation of STEMI with high accuracy. 17 When ST-segment elevation or an equivalent ﬁnding is present on the initial ECG (Table 3), initial manage- ment and triage should follow the prescribed STEMI treatment algorithm. Electrocardiographic changes are not required to conﬁrm a diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). 2. In patients for whom the initial ECG is nondiagnostic, serial ECGs should be performed during transport to the hospital especially when clinical suspicion of ACS is high, ischemic symptoms are persistent, or the clinical condition deteriorates. 3,4 Acquisition of sub- sequent ECGs should not delay transport to a hospi- tal. A second and/or third ECG during EMS transport may identify up to 15% of additional STEMI cases not present on the ﬁrst ECG. 3 In an observational study of 728 patients with suspected ACS who underwent serial prehospital ECGs, a STEMI diagnosis was sub- sequently made in 8% of patients following an initial nondiagnostic ECG with a median of 12 minutes after the ﬁrst study. 4 Posterior ECG leads (V7-V9)s h o u l db e applied in patients with ongoing symptoms and a nondiagnostic ECG and those with ST-segment de- pressions in leads V 1-V3 to assess for ST-segment elevation in the posterior leads, which could indi- cate a posterior STEMI. 3. PPCI is the preferred method of reperfusion for pa- tients with STEMI. 18 Rapid reperfusion of the infarct- related artery is associated with improved myocardial salvage and improved survival. 19,20 For those who are managed by PPCI, each 30 minutes of delay is associ- ated with an increase in th e relative risk of 1-year m o r t a l i t yb y7 . 5 % . 19 As such, evidence supports system-level interventions to reduce time-to-device. 11 Patients with prehospital identi ﬁcation of STEMI should preferentially be transported to a PCI-capable hospital with a goal of FMC –to–ﬁrst-device time of #90 minutes. 20 For patients who are directly trans- ported to the hospital by EMS, the time to treatment goal is de ﬁned as the FMC by EMS until coronary reperfusion. Direct transfer to a PCI-capable facility has been associated with shor ter reperfusion times and lower mortality compared with transport to the closest non–PCI-capable hospital. 21 In prehospital settings where a FMC–to–ﬁrst-device goal of#90 minutes is not feasible in patients with STEMI, direct transport to a PCI-capable hospital may be considered if the antici- pated FMC-to-device time is #120 minutes. 22,23 See Section 5.1 , “Regional Systems of STEMI Care, ” for further details. 4. The implementation of several care processes has demonstrated signi ﬁcant reductions in reperfusion times in patients with STEMI when implemented within a regional medical system. 24 These include (1) prehospital catheterization laboratory activation, (2) single call transfer protocol for patients from a non- PCI facility, and (3) ED bypass to transport patients directly to the catheteriza tion laboratory for those presenting by EMS to a PCI-capable hospital, and for transfers from other facilities. In particular, the pre- hospital activation of catheterization laboratories has been associated with lower short- and long-term mortality in patients presenting with STEMI. 1,8,25 See Section 5.1 , “Regional Systems of STEMI Care, ” for further details.

Initial In-Hospital Assessment of Patients With Conﬁrmed or Suspected ACS Synopsis Chest pain is the second most common presenting complaint to EDs in the United States and has a wide array of potential causes, including ACS. 14 Although most pa- tients with chest pain will not have an ultimate diagnosis of ACS, a missed ACS event has signiﬁcant implications for the patient ’s morbidity and mortality. Patients pre- senting with signs or symptoms of ACS should undergo a history and physical examination, have timely electro- cardiographic acquisition and interpretation ( Table 3 ), and assessment of cardiac troponin, because these tests are central to the diagnosis of MI 15 a n dw i l lg u i d ep a t i e n t management ( Figure 3 ). A thorough description of the evaluation of patients with suspected ACS is provided in the “2021 AHA/ACC/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR Guideline for the Evaluation and Diagnosis of Chest Pain. ” 13 Initial medical treatment should begin immedi- ately for patients with presumed ACS. Urgent echocardi- ography, which may include an initial point-of-care ultrasound by trained clinicians, is indicated for patients with cardiogenic shock, hemodynamic instability, or for suspected mechanical comp lications. For patients with suspected STEMI, rapid reperf usion is critical after diag- nosis, and further diagnostic testing should not delay cardiac catheterization or ﬁbrinolytic therapy unless it would immediately change patient management. For pa- tients who warrant additional testing to con ﬁrm a diag- nosis of ACS, selection of the method of assessment may encompass several factors, including clinical history, electrocardiographic ﬁndings, cardiac biomarkers, patient preference, and patient exercise capacity. The use of evidence-based clinical decision pathways (CDPs) has been shown to improve outcomes and direct appropriate use of resources. 13 CDPs reduce unnecessary testing in 21% to 43% of patients while maintaining a high negative predictive value for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). 16-19 Recommendation-speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. A focused history and rapid evaluation are critical in the assessment of a patient with suspected ACS.13 Early recognition and initiation of therapy for ACS improves outcomes. 2,20 Rapid electrocardiographic acquisition and interpretation is required for identi ﬁcation of STEMI (Table 3). In patients with NSTE-ACS, the ECG may be normal or demonstrate transient ST-segment elevation (a high-risk ﬁnding), ST-segment depres- sion, T-wave inversions, or nonspeci ﬁcc h a n g e s .O f note, ST-segment depression in the anteroseptal leads (V 1-V3) could indicate an evolving posterior STEMI and therefore should be managed with a high index of suspicion with a posterior lead ECG if warranted (Table 3 ). 21 Overall, timely acquisition of an ECG is imperative in patients with a goal to obtain and inter- pret an ECG by a trained clinician within 10 minutes of presentation. 1 2. An initial nondiagnostic 12-lead ECG does not “rule out” or exclude ACS. Electrocardiographic abnormal- ities may be dynamic. A nondiagnostic ECG should be compared to prior ECGs, and a repeat ECG should be obtained during the ED course to assess for evolving changes. 3 Right-sided leads should be obtained in pa- tients with a concern for inferior STEMI to evaluate for right ventricular involvement. 22 Assessment for pos- terior STEMI with an ECG is described inTable 3.T h e Recommendations for Initial In-Hospital Assessment of Patients With Con ﬁrmed or Suspected ACS Referenced studies that support recommendations are summarized in the Evidence Table .

In patients with suspected ACS with an initial hs-cTn or cTn that is nondiagnostic, the recom- mended time intervals for repeat measurements after the initial sample collection (time zero) are 1 to 2 hours for hs-cTn and 3 to 6 hours for conventional cTn assays. * 8-12 *Adapted from the “2021 AHA/ACC/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR Guideline for the Evaluation and Diagnosis of Chest Pain.”13 JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 Rao et al JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline 2149 timing of repeat ECGs should be guided by the pa- tient ’s symptoms, especially recurrent chest pain, and any change in clinical condition. 15 In NCDR ACTION (National Cardiovascular Data Registry and Acute Cor- onary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network), 11% of patients ultimately diagnosed with STEMI had an initial ECG that was nondiagnostic, and 72.4% of those patients had a follow-up ECG diagnostic of STEMI within 90 minutes of their initial ECG. 3 3. cTn is the biomarker of choice for assessing patients for possible cardiac injury, with hs-cTn assays being preferred. cTn is central to the diagnosis of AMI. 15 Given its high sensitivity and speci ﬁcity for myocar- dial injury, cTn (I or T) should be utilized to detect or exclude myocardial injury. 7 In the setting of electro- cardiographic evidence of STEMI, reperfusion therapy should not be delayed pending biomarker results.

AMI is characterized by a rising and/or falling pattern of cTn values with at least 1 value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit and believed caused by myocardial ischemia. 21 With the development of hs- cTn assays enabling detection of circulating cTn at lower concentrations, CDPs using serial testing of hs- c T na tp r e s e n t a t i o n( 0h o u r s )a n d1t o2h o u r sl a t e r provide high negative predictive value, as well as accelerated recognition of myocardial injury. 9,10,12 Clinicians should be familiar with both the evidence- based CDPs and the analytical characteristics of the cTn assay (ie, limit of quanti ﬁcation, 99th percentile upper reference limit, and criteria for signi ﬁcant change) used in their practice. 24,26 Men and women may have different cutoff values with hs-cTn assays. With hs-cTn assays, changes in hs-cTn concentration within the normal reference range but below the 99th percentile upper reference limit can signal cardiac ischemia and may warrant further evaluation. CDPs incorporating hs-cTn assays with repeat sampling at 1 or 2 hours from ED arrival with calculation of the change or “delta ” hs-cTn can identify patients at very low risk (eg, negative predictive value >99.5%) based on assay-speci ﬁcd i a g n o s t i ct h r e s h o l d s . 8,11,27-30 How- ever, when using conventional cTn assays, the sam- pling timeframe is extended to 3 to 6 hours from ED arrival. 31 cTn may be within normal range early after symptom onset especially when a high-sensitivity assay is not used. When using a CDP that in- corporates a single hs-cTn value, the troponin should be obtained at least 3 hours after the onset of symptoms. 32 3.1.3. Risk Stratiﬁcation Tools for Patients With STEMI and NSTE-ACS Synopsis Substantial variability in short-term mortality and MACE risk exists among patients with ACS. Individual risk assessment can inform discussions with patients and decisions regarding therapeutic interventions. Several risk scores have been developed and validated to help assess a patient’s short- and long-term risk in established ACS using commonly available clinical and laboratory variables. Although seve ral risk scores exist, 1-3 the GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) and TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) Risk Scores for NSTE-ACS and STEMI (Table 5) are well validated and may be useful for helping to guide some therapeutic de- cisions (Section 6.1., “Rationale and Timing for a Routine Invasive or Selective Invasive Approach”). 4-7 These scores are not to be used as diagnostic tools, because they stratify patient risk in the setting of suspected or conﬁrmed ACS. Risk assessment using the GRACE Risk Score has been found to be superior to subjective physi- cian assessment for the prediction of death or MI in pa- tients with STEMI or inter mediate-risk NSTE-ACS. 8 However, there is insuf ﬁcient evidence that routine use of risk scores in patients hospitalized for STEMI/NSTE- ACS translates into reduced risk of cardiovascular events. 9,10 Evidence of HF, such as pulmonary congestion detec- ted by physical examination, chest x-ray, or lung ultra- sound, is an important risk marker and integral part of the Killip classi ﬁcation (and thereby the GRACE Risk Score a n dT I M IR i s kS c o r ef o rS T E M I )i np a t i e n t sw i t hA C S . 11-15 Similarly, elevated cardia c biomarkers provide prog- nostic information and also are key elements of the GRACE and TIMI Risk Scores. Higher cTn levels in patients with ACS are associated with an increased risk of death and MACE 16,17 and similarly may be useful for helping t og u i d es o m et r e a t m e n td e c i s i o n s .4,18 Several other serum or plasma biomarkers may provide additional prognostic information. In particular, natriuretic peptides (including B-type natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro- B-type natriuretic peptide) may identify those patients with ACS at increased risk of death, HF, and recurrent MACE. 19,20 Early recognition of cardiogenic shock in patients presenting with ACS on FMC by EMS or ED providers is the key to initial triage and risk strati ﬁcation. 21 Cardio- genic shock related to AMI is present in 7% to 10% of the ACS population and carries a high mortality rate. 22 Early and rapid revasculariza tion for cardiogenic shock related to AMI is associated with increased survival, and triage to a PCI-capable hospital and ideally to hospitals providing advanced therapies (eg, mechanical circula- tory support [MCS]) is preferred ( Section 8.1 , “Revas- cularization in ACS With Cardiogenic Shock ” and Section 8.2 , “MCS in Patients With ACS and Cardio- genic Shock ”). Several scales are available to determine the severity of shock, and observational data have shown associations between severity as assessed by these scales and outcomes. 23 JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 Rao et al JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline 2151 3.2. Management of Patients Presenting With Cardiac Arrest Synopsis Approximately 10% of patients with STEMI transferred by EMS to the hospital are estimated to have an out-of- hospital cardiac arrest. 15 Early recognition of STEMI in resuscitated patients and direct transfer to a PCI-capable center is associated with improved survival. 1,2 Survival- to-hospital discharge in the patient who is comatose with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is <10% regardless of etiology. 16 Those with a witnessed arrest and a shockable rhythm have improved survival. Outcomes for patients with STEMI who are awake after resuscitated cardiac ar- rest are comparable to patients with STEMI who were not in cardiac arrest. 3 For this reason, patients with cardiac arrest who have achieved return of spontaneous circula- tion (ROSC) and are awake with STEMI on ECG are can- didates for PPCI. However, care should be individualized in the comatose patient with rapid assessment of the pa- tient ’s clinical features and cardiac arrest characteristics before proceeding with invasive angiography. 17-19 In contrast, patients who are stable without ST-segment elevation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest do not require immediate coronary angiography. Coronary angi- ography can be deferred pen ding further risk strati ﬁca- tion. 8-13 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Observational studies have shown an association be- tween triage of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients to a PCI-capable facility with improved outcomes. 1,2,15 Data from the CARES (Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival) registry showed that transfer to a PCI-capable center was associated with improved sur- vival in patients with cardiac arrest and STEMI on ECG.

Nearly one-third of patients with cardiac arrest and STEMI on ECG have normal neurologic status on pre- sentation to the ED. 3 Being alert or with partial/mini- mal neurologic response on presentation with STEMI after cardiac arrest is an independent predictor of survival. Observational studies have demonstrated comparable survival of the awake patient with STEMI with cardiac arrest to those patients with STEMI without cardiac arrest. 3 For this reason, patients with STEMI who have achieved ROSC and are awake should undergo PPCI (Section 5.2.1, “PPCI in STEMI”). 3. In patients who are comatose after cardiac arrest and have achieved ROSC, but have STEMI on the ECG, an individualized patient assessment for survival and fu- tility is essential before proceeding with PCI. Observa- tional data have identiﬁed poor prognostic features that have been validated and incorporated into risk scores for this population. These include unwitnessed arrest, no bystander cardio pulmonary resuscitation, nonshockable rhythm, cardi opulmonary resuscitation >30 minutes, time to ROSC >30 minutes, arterial pH <7.2, lactate >7 mmol/L, age >85 years, and end- stage renal disease on dialysis. 4,21-30 Although these data suggest a lack of clear beneﬁt for invasive therapies for patients with STEMI and cardiac arrest who have features indicating an unfavorable neurologic prog- nosis, 4,7 this has not been validated in prospective trials.

Six contemporary trials 9-14 have evaluated the role of emergency angiography in patients who remain comatose after cardiac arrest, do not have ST-segment elevation on a 12-lead ECG, and are electrically and hemodynamically stable. These studies consistently demonstrated a lack of bene ﬁt to early angiography when compared with delayed or no angiography in the study population with comparable in-hospital and 6- month survival, as well as neurologic recovery. 31 The relative utility of delayed coronary angiography in this population is uncertain. 4.

Although exclus ion criteria varied among studies, patients with a home oxygen requirement, active bronchospasm requiring supple- mental oxygen, or with cardiac arrest at presentation were excluded. 2-4,6 The AVOID (Air Versus Oxygen in ST-Segment-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) trial investigated the effects of supplemental oxygen (8 L/min) in patients with STEMI and oxygen saturations $94% and demonstrated a lack of beneﬁt with routine supplemental oxygen, including a possible increase in myocardial injury and infarct size. 3 DETO2X-AMI (Ef ﬁcacy and Outcome Study of Supplemental Oxygen Treatment in Patients With Suspected Myocardial Infarction) evaluated the use of routine supplemental oxygen (6 L/min) in 6,629 pa- tients with suspected MI and an oxygen saturation $90%. 2 The use of supplemental oxygen did not reduce all-cause mortality at 1 year and did not reduce rehospitalization with MI. 2,9 A consistent lack of clinical beneﬁt was seen in the study for those with lower baseline oxygen saturations (90%-94%). 10 4.2. Analgesics Synopsis Patients presenting with known or suspected ACS often experience chest pain or other uncomfortable symptoms. Rapid and effective pain relief remains an important treatment goal to prevent sy mpathetic activation and adverse clinical sequelae ( Table 6 ). Analgesic therapies may provide symptomatic relief, but they have not been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with ACS. 1,2 Nitrates and opiate medications remain effective treatment options for management of pain in ACS but should be thoughtfully ut ilized to prevent potential harm. 3-6 In particular, rapid coronary revascularization should be pursued for patients with ongoing ischemic symptoms that are not relieved with nitrates, and opiates should not be used solely to mask these symptoms. Concerns have also been raised that the use of opiates may delay gastric and intestinal absorption of orally administered P2Y12 inhibit ors, thereby delaying their pharmacodynamic effects in patients undergoing PCI. 7-10 However, the clinical relevance of these pharmacody- namic ﬁndings remains disputed. 11-14 Use of nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-in ﬂammatory drugs should be avoided for management of suspected or known ischemia pain whenever possible. 15-17 Use of nonsteroidal anti- inﬂammatory drugs is associated with increased risk of MACE in patients with and without prior cardiac disease, with no documented bene ﬁt to support routine use in patients with ACS. 15-19 TABLE 6 Analgesic Treatment Options for Cardiac Chest Pain Medication Route Suggested Dosing Considerations Nitroglycerin* SL (tablets, spray) 0.3 or 0.4 mg every 5 min as needed up to a total of 3 doses Use in hemodynamically stable patients with SBP$90 mm Hg.

Aspirin Synopsis Aspirin has long been considered an integral part of antiplatelet therapy to prevent recurrent athero- thrombotic events among patients with ACS. 1-3,6 Aspirin reduces the incidence of vascular death after AMI,3 and in secondary prevention trials (that include patients after MI), it reduces the occurrence of vascular and coronary events, including MI and stroke. 2 Although aspirin use after ACS was traditionally considered lifelong, a strategy of aspirin discontinuation, rather than P2Y12 inhibitor discontinuation, may now be considered in the mainte- nance phase after 1 to 3 months in selected patients to reduce risk of bleeding (Section 11.1, “DAPT Strategies in the First 12 Months Postdischarge ”). Aspirin discontinu- ation after 1 to 4 weeks after PCI is also appropriate for patients on a full-dose anticoagulant in combination with continued use of a P2Y12 inhibitor (Section 11.1.1 , “Anti- platelet Therapy in Patient s on Anticoagulation Post- discharge ”). For patients in whom a history of aspirin hypersensitivity is reported, aspirin desensitization is preferred whenever possible to allow for initial use of dual antiplatelet therapy. 7-9 The use of a P2Y12 inhibitor is recommended in all patient s with ACS regardless of whether they have a history of aspirin hypersensitivity, but should be administered with a loading dose as early as possible for those patients unable to take aspirin at presentation. Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. Aspirin should be initiat ed with a loading dose (162- 3 2 5m g )i np a t i e n t sw i t hA C Sw i t h o u ta na b s o l u t e contraindication as soon as possible on presentation irrespective of ﬁnal management strategy (invasive or noninvasive), followed by a daily maintenance dose (Table 7 in Section 4.3.2 , “Oral P2Y12 Inhibitors During Hospitalization ”). In patients who cannot take oral medication, rectal or intravenous (where avail- able) administration are options for administration. Current evidence supports the use of uncoated low- dose aspirin (75-100 mg) for daily maintenance t h e r a p y .T h e7 5t o1 0 0m gd a i l yd o s eo fa s p i r i ne x - ceeds the minimal effective dose required for platelet thromboxane A 2 suppression, allowing for some interindividual variability in drug response. 10 Among patients with ACS referred for an invasive strategy, continued use of full-dose aspirin (300-325 mg daily) for 30 days (following an initial loading dose) was not superior to low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg daily) for reduction of MACE but was associated with increased minor and gastrointestinal bleeding. 4 In an open-label RCT of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovas cular disease (ASCVD), 35% of whom had a previous MI, no signi ﬁcant differ- ences were observed in MACE or major bleeding for patients treated with 81 mg of aspirin daily and those treated with 325 mg daily, although a high degree of crossover between study arms was observed. 5 Together, these data support the use of low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg daily) for maintenance therapy. Based on an association between aspirin dosing and outcomes in a post hoc analysis of the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trial, aspirin doses of #100 mg daily should always be used in patients treated with ticagrelor. 11 Recommendation for Aspirin Referenced studies that support recommendations are summarized in the Evidence Table .

Oral P2Y12 Inhibitors During Hospitalization Synopsis Oral inhibitors of the platelet P2Y12 receptor antago- nize adenosine diphosphate –mediated activation of platelets. Across the spectrum of ACS, the addition of a P2Y12 inhibitor to aspirin signi ﬁcantly reduces platelet a g g r e g a t i o na n dh a sb e e ns h o w nt or e d u c et h ei n c i d e n c e of recurrent MACE but with an increased risk of bleeding. 1-5,9,10 In addition to receiving aspirin, patients w i t hA C Ss h o u l dt h e r e f o r eb et r e a t e dw i t hal o a d i n gd o s e of an oral P2Y12 inhibitor followed by daily dosing (Table 7). The selection of the speciﬁct y p eo fo r a lP 2 Y 1 2 inhibitor should involve several considerations, including the patient’s anticipated management strategy and their risk of bleeding (Figure 4). 1-5,9,10 Clinically available oral P2Y12 inhibitors include clopidogrel, prasugrel, and tica- grelor. Clopidogrel is the least potent oral P2Y12 inhibitor and requires more time to reach its maximal platelet in- hibition after a loading dose, because it requires biotransformation in the liver to form its active metabo- lite. Pharmacodynamic variability in response in clopi- dogrel has been well described, 14,15 and hyporesponders may be at increased risk of MACE and stent thrombosis when treated with clopidogrel after PCI. 16,17 Ticagrelor Recommendations for Oral P2Y12 Inhibitors During Hospitalization Referenced studies that support recommendations are summarized in the Evidence Table .

Of note, ticagrelor may cause subjective transient dyspnea in approximately 10% to 15% of patients after ACS. 5 The topic of duration of dual antiplatelet therapy is addressed in Section 11.1, “DAPT Strategies in the First 12 Months Postdischarge. ” Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Several trials have demonstrated the clinical beneﬁto f oral P2Y12 inhibitors in ACS for reducing MACE but with increased risk of bleeding. In randomized placebo-controlled trials in both NSTE-ACS and STEMI, the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin reduced risk of MACE irrespective of management strategy. 1-3 In pa- tients with STEMI treated withﬁbrinolytic therapy, the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin reduces 30-day MACE, including recurrent MI, and improves sur- vival. 2,3 Moreover, in randomized trials, the use of prasugrel and ticagrelor further reduced risk of MACE, as well as stent thrombosis, when compared with clo- pidogrel in patients with STEMI (not receiving con- current ﬁbrinolytic therapy) or NSTE-ACS. 4,5 The beneﬁts of oral P2Y12 inhibitors have also been demonstrated in patients after coronary artery bypass TABLE 7 Dosing Considerations for Oral Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients With ACS Agent Setting Dosing Considerations Aspirin NSTE-ACS or STEMI Loading dose 162-325 mg orally.

Duration of administration after CABG is described in Section 11.1 , “DAPT Strategies in the First 12 Months Postdischarge. ” 2. In a secondary analysis of the randomized, double- blind TRITON-TIMI 38 (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet In- hibition with Prasugrel –Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 38) of prasugrel versus clopidogrel In addition to aspirin among patients with ACS, sub- group analyses using an outcome of net clinical beneﬁt (MACE events plus bleeding) demonstrated net harm with prasugrel versus clopidogrel among patients with previous tr ansient ischemic attack or stroke. 4 Dose reduction of prasugrel should be considered in patients $75 years of age and in those with a body weight <60 kg (Table 7). 3. The randomized, double-blind TRITON-TIMI 38 and PLATO trials demonstrated that prasugrel (TRITON- T I M I3 8 )o rt i c a g r e l o r( P L A T O )r e d u c e dt h er a t eo ft h e composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke by 16% to 20% when compared with clopidogrel, as well as reduced the risk of stent thrombosis. 4,5 In the PLATO trial, a nominal reduction in all-cause death with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel was also observed. 5 In TRITON-TIMI 38, the P2Y12 inhibitor (prasugrel or clopidogrel) was only administered in patients with NSTE-ACS once the anatomy was deemed s u i t a b l ef o rP C I .I nt h eP L A T Ot r i a l ,7 2 %w e r em a n a g e d with a planned invasive strategy and results in the invasively managed population were highly consistent with the overall trial for reducing MACE, as well as cardiovascular and all-cause death individually. 6 Both prasugrel and ticagrelor increase the risk of non-CABG major bleeding compared with clopidogrel. 4,5 Prasugrel has been shown to increase life-threatening bleeds. 4 Limited data exist to compare the efﬁcacy and safety of prasugrel versus ticagrelor head-to-head. One open- label randomized trial reported a lower rate of MACE with similar bleeding with prasugrel administered at the time of PCI compared with ticagrelor used as up- stream therapy in patients with ACS undergoing inva- sive evaluation. 22 4. The randomized, double-blind PLATO trial of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel included patients with ACS managed with or without a planned invasive strategy. Among the 28% of patients (n ¼ 5,216) who were managed without a planned invasive strategy, a 15% reduction was observed in the primary endpoint of vascular death, MI, or stroke with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel that was highly consistent with the 16% reduction in MACE in the overall trial. Similarly, the ﬁndings for bleeding were consistent with the overall trial result. 5,7 5. In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events) trial, among patients with NSTE-ACS receiving aspirin and who were medically managed or underwent revascularizati on, the administration of clopidogrel signi ﬁcantly reduced the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke. 1 Although prasu- grel and ticagrelor further reduce major cardiovascular events compared with clopidogrel in patients with ACS undergoing PCI, these more potent agents also further increase the risk of bleeding. 4,5 Clopidogrel is an effective alternative P2Y12 inhibitor for use in patients with high bleeding risk or contraindications to prasu- grel or ticagrelor. In an open-label trial with a high crossover rate among older patients with ACS under- going PCI, patients treated with clopidogrel had a similar rate of ischemic events and less bleeding compared with ticagrelor. 23 Signi ﬁcant interpatient variability in the pharmacodynamic response to clopi- dogrel has been described. 15 6. In a prospective substudy among the patients who underwent PCI (n¼ 2,658) in the CURE trial, those who were pretreated with clopidogrel (median 6 days) prior to PCI had a signi ﬁcantly lower rate of MACE both before PCI and by 30 days.8 Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires metabolism by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system to form its active metabolite and therefore may require several hours before signiﬁcant antiplatelet effect is observed following a loading dose. A meta-analysis of trials of clopidogrel in patients with ACS undergoing PCI found that pretreatment with clopidogrel signi ﬁcantly reduced the risk for 30-day cardiovascular death or MI. 11 However, less is known regarding the need for pretreatment in the era of more potent P2Y12 inhibitors with more rapid onset of anti- platelet action. In a randomized trial of prasugrel pre- treatment versus adminis tration at the time of PCI, pretreatment (median of only 4.4 hours) did not improve ischemic outcomes, but signi ﬁcantly TABLE 8 Management of Oral P2Y12 Inhibitors for Patients Who Require CABG Surgery * Clopidogrel Elective CABG: Interrupt for 5 d before surgery. Urgent CABG: Interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 5 d may be reasonable. Prasugrel Elective CABG: Interrupt for 7 d before surgery. Urgent CABG: Interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 7 d may be reasonable. Ticagrelor Elective CABG: Interrupt for 3-5 d before surgery. Urgent CABG: Interruption for at least 24 h (ideally) and proceeding earlier than 5 d may be reasonable. *For all patients, oral P2Y12 inhibitor should be resumed after surgery when bleeding risk not excessive (typically 24-72 hours). CABG indicates coronary artery bypass grafting. Rao et al JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2158 increased bleeding. 24 In the PLATO trial, knowledge of coronary anatomy prior to administration of the study drug was not required; however, upstream use of ticagrelor was not speciﬁcally compared with a strategy of administration at time of PCI. Therefore, it remains unknown whether a beneﬁt exists for administration of ticagrelor prior to PCI in patients with NSTE-ACS. For this reason, routine pretre atment in patients under- going an early invasive management strategy ( <24 hours) is not supported by clinical trial data. However, it may be reasonable to consider pretreatment with clopidogrel or ticagrelor in patients undergoing an invasive management strategy with the timing of angiography anticipated to be $24 hours from admin- istration of the loading dose. 7. The clinical ef ﬁcacy of prasugrel and ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel in TRITON-TIMI 38 and the PLATO trial was consistent in patients undergoing PPCI or delayed (ie, secondary) PCI after initial therapy for STEMI. 4,5 In the subgroup of patients with STEMI in TRITON-TIMI 38 (n ¼ 3,534), prasugrel signi ﬁcantly r e d u c e dM A C Eb y2 1 %a n ds t e n tt h r o m b o s i sb y4 2 %a t1 5 months without a clear excess in bleeding. 9 In the P L A T Ot r i a l ,c o m p a r e dw i t hc l o p i d o g r e l ,t r e a t m e n to f patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI (n¼ 7,544) with ticagrelor was associated with a consistent trend toward reduction in cardiovascular death, recurrent MI, or stroke, as well as a signi ﬁcant reduction in stent t h r o m b o s i sa n da n1 8 %r e d u c t i o ni na l l - c a u s ed e a t h . 10 Both TRITON-TIMI 38 and the PLATO trial permitted study drug administration prior to the initial angiogram for patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. In a separate randomized trial in PPCI for STEMI, allocation to prehospital ticagrelor or hospital administration did not improve the primary endpoint of coronary reperfu- sion prior to the PCI. 25 However, upstream administra- tion of ticagrelor was associated with a reduction in stent thrombosis with similar bleeding between treat- ment groups. Registry data have also not shown clear clinical bene ﬁt for preloading a P2Y12 inhibitor in pa- tients with STEMI, 26 but a meta-analysis that included patients with STEMI showed that clopidogrel pretreat- ment was associated with a lower risk for MACE without an increase in bleeding. 27 8. Clopidogrel is effective for prevention of stent throm- bosis and early recurrent ischemic events in patients with STEMI undergoing PCI. 11 As in patients with NSTE-ACS, in patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI, prasugrel and ticagrelor reduce the risk of recurrent MACE compared with clopidogrel. 9,10 Administration of clopidogrel is an alternative to prasugrel or tica- grelor in patients with STEMI who are at high bleeding risk or have other contraindications to those agents. 9. In the CLARITY (Clopidogrel as Adjunctive Reperfu- sions Therapy)-TIMI 28 trial, addition of clopidogrel t oa s p i r i ni np a t i e n t sw i t hS T E M Iw h ow e r e<75 years of age and received ﬁbrinolytic therapy reduced the odds of an occluded infarct-related artery at angiog- raphy, as well as the composite of cardiovascular death, recurrent MI, or recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization by 30 days. 2 In the ran- domized, placebo-controlled COMMIT (Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in Myocardia lI n f a r c t i o nT r i a l )s t u d y among patients with suspected MI (93% STEMI, 54% ﬁbrinolytic-treated) receiving aspirin, clopidogrel 75 mg/day (without a loading dose), signi ﬁcantly low- ered the risk of the composite endpoint of death, reinfarction, or stroke, as well as the endpoint of mortality alone, with a consistent pattern in the subgroup treated with ﬁbrinolytic. 3 No signi ﬁcant excess was observed in bleeding with clopidogrel versus placebo. Based on the design of these 2 trials, when administered concurrently with ﬁbrinolytic as the reperfusion strategy, clopidogrel is recommended to be administered with a loading dose (300 mg, then 75 mg daily) for patients <75 years of age and start- ing without a loading dose (75 mg daily) for patients $75 years of age. In patients treated with a ﬁbrinolytic agent who are undergoing subsequent PCI, either clopidogre lo rt i c a g r e l o r( a g e<75 years, within 24 hours after a ﬁbrinolytic agent) or prasu- grel ( >24 hours after a ﬁbrinolytic agent) are alter- natives to support PCI. 9-12 ,28 In a trial of 3,799 patients with STEMI who were treated with a ﬁbri- nolytic agent, 89% of whom also received clopidogrel at the time of a ﬁbrinolytic agent, randomization to ticagrelor administered at a median of 11.4 hours (interquartile range, 5.8-18.2 hours) after ﬁbrinolytic therapy was noninferior to clopidogrel with respect to major bleeding. 28 4.3.3.

Among patients with ACS under- going PCI who have not received a P2Y12 inhibitor, intravenous cangrelor may be reasonable to reduce periprocedural ischemic events. * 1-4 *Reproduced from the “2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization.”5 JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 Rao et al JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline 2159 Synopsis Cangrelor is a direct-acting, intravenous antagonist of the P2Y12 receptor characterized by rapid and potent platelet inhibitory effects w ith restoration of platelet function occurring within 1 hour of drug discontinuation. 6 These pharmacological prop erties may be particularly beneﬁcial in clinical scenarios wherein absorption of orally administered P2Y12 inhibitors is impaired or not p o s s i b l e ,a sw e l la si np a t i e n t sr e q u i r i n gC A B Go ro t h e r surgery early after PCI when prolonged discontinuation of a P2Y12 inhibitor may not be safe. 7 The safety and efﬁcacy of cangrelor has been compared with clopidogrel or placebo in 3 RCTs involving patients who are P2Y12 inhibitor-naïve and undergoing PCI for stable or acute indications. 1-3 In a patient-level pooled analysis of these studies, cangrelor administered during PCI signi ﬁcantly reduced periprocedural ischemic events albeit at the expense of more frequent minor bleeding. 4 The safety and efﬁcacy of cangrelor versus ticagrelor or prasugrel with respect to ischemic events have not been established. The transition from intravenous to oral P2Y12 inhibition is an important consideration to ensure adequate platelet inhi- bition on completion of cangrelor infusion (Table 9).8 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supporting Text 1. CHAMPION PHOENIX (A Clinical Trial Comparing Can- grelor to Clopidogrel Standard Therapy in Subjects Who Require PCI) examined the effect of cangrelor versus clopidogrel in patients undergoing PCI for acute or stable coronary syndromes. 2 Cangrelor was adminis- tered as an intravenous bolus prior to PCI followed by an infusion for at least 2 hours or for the duration of the procedure, whichever was longer. In the control arm, clopidogrel was administered as a 600- or 300-mg loading dose immediately before or after PCI. At 48 hours, the primary endpoint of all-cause death, MI, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis was signiﬁcantly reduced with cangrelor with similar effects observed among those presenting with NSTE- ACS (n ¼ 2,810) or STEMI (n ¼ 1,991). These results contrast with the earlier neutral ﬁndings from the CHAMPION PLATFORM (Cangrelor Versus Standard Therapy to Achieve Optimal Management of Platelet Inhibition) trial and CHAMPION PCI (A Clinical Trial to Demonstrate the Ef ﬁcacy of Cangrelor), which compared cangrelor with placebo and clopidogrel, respectively. 1,3 D i f f e r e n c e sa c r o s st r i a l si nt h et i m i n go f clopidogrel administration and de ﬁnitions of MI and stent thrombosis may in part account for variability in the incidence of ischemic events and observed treat- ment effect. In a pooled analysis of these trials, can- grelor was associated with a signi ﬁcant reduction in periprocedural ischemic events compared with control with no evidence of heterogeneity across types of ACS presentations. 4 4.3.4.

These agents were ﬁrst evaluated before contemporary antiplatelet an d interventional strategies w e r ei n t r o d u c e da n di na ne r aw h e nt h et i m et oc o r o n a r y revascularization was substantially longer than today. Thus, limited data are available for glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors in patients receiving more potent P2Y12 in- hibitors and in those receiving earlier PCI with contem- porary drug-eluting stents that have a lower risk for stent thrombosis than prior generations of stents. In current practice, the role of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor in- hibitors is largely limited to adjunctive use at the time of PCI in patients with large thrombus burden or as“rescue ” or “bailout ” therapy in patients with PCI complications such as no-reﬂow or persistent or recurring thrombus at the lesion. 1 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In a study of 452 selected high-risk patients with large anterior STEMI and a large thrombus burden, adjunctive use of intracoronary abciximab reduced thrombus burden and infarct size. 1 Other trials have also suggested that glycoprot ein IIb/IIIa inhibitors can reduce intracoronary thrombus burden in patients with STEMI and NSTE-ACS. 7,8 Thus, glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa receptor inhibitors can be considered at the time of PCI for patients with a large coronary thrombus burden or no-re ﬂow or slow ﬂow that is believed to be attributable to distal embolization of thrombus. In clinical trials comparing intravenous and intra- coronary administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in- h i b i t o r s ,c l i n i c a la n db l e e d i n go u t c o m e s ,a sw e l la s thrombus resolution and inf arct size, have generally been similar. 2,9,10 2. Multiple strategies have been evaluated for use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors in patients with ACS. “Upstream ” administration of these agents is deﬁned as administration of small molecule agents (epti ﬁbatide or tiroﬁban) early after ACS diagnosis for medical stabilization prior to planned angiography a n dP C I .I nt h eE A R L Y - A C S( E a r l yG l y c o p r o t e i nI I b / IIIa Inhibition in Patients with Non-ST-segment Elevation Acute Coronary Sy ndrome) trial, 9,406 pa- tients with NSTE-ACS were randomized to routine upstream use of epti ﬁbatide (within 8 hours after presentation to the hospital) versus ad hoc adjunctive use at the time of PCI among patients with NSTE- ACS. 4 Ischemic outcomes were not improved and bleeding was increased in the routine upstream eptiﬁbatide arm.

Although early trials perfo rmed prior to use of potent P2Y12 inhibitors suggested that this approach improved procedural outcomes and reduced peri- procedural myocardial necrosis, studies performed among patients receiving pretreatment with clopi- dogrel have not con ﬁrmed reduction of ischemic events with routine adjunctive glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition and have increased bleeding complications. 5,11 4.4.

Although eventual diagnostic reclassi ﬁcation can occur (ie, to other non- atherothrombotic ACS diagn oses such as coronary spasm or other conditions that can mimic ACS, such as stress cardiomyopathy or myocarditis), initial parenteral anti- coagulation is intended to treat thrombus caused by atherosclerotic plaque disru ption (rupture or erosion) in patients with presumed type 1 MI. 32 Anticoagulation s t r a t e g i e sa r et ob ei n i t i a t e du p s t r e a m( a tt h et i m eo f diagnosis and prior to coronary angiography) and to support PCI or other reperfusion therapy. In patients with ACS undergoing PCI, intraprocedural thrombin genera- tion and platelet aggregation may occur, for which reason parenteral anticoagulation is recommended to reduce the risk for thrombotic complications. 33 The choice of a parenteral anticoagulant can be complex because it is inﬂuenced by various factors, including vascular access site, renal function, and concomitant use of other anti- platelet or anticoagulant agents. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia can occur with both UFH and low- molecular-weight heparin; in this context, argatroban and bivalirudin are direct thrombin inhibitors that are acceptable alternative anticoagulants for patients with known heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. 34,35 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. UFH has traditionally been the preferred anticoagu- lant to treat patients with NSTE-ACS. 1-4 However, limitations to its use include the lack of a predictable dose response and risk of heparin-induced thrombo- cytopenia. 33 In unstable angina, a meta-analysis including 1,353 patients enrolled from 6 randomized studies showed that, in comparison to patients t r e a t e dw i t ha s p i r i na l o n e ,t h o s et r e a t e dw i t ha s p i r i n and heparin were at lower, albeit nonstatistically signi ﬁcant, risk for MI or death during the randomized treatment period (relative risk, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.44- 1.02]). 3 Its efﬁcacy compared with placebo has not been evaluated in the current era of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and early revascularization. 33 2. Fondaparinux, a synthe tic pentasaccharide that selectively binds antithrombin and causes rapid and predictable inhibition of Factor Xa, was evaluated in Continued COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1 B-R 5.

In patients with STEMI treated with ﬁbrinolytic therapy who are not intended to undergo an invasive approach, enoxaparin is the recommended anticoagu- lant to reduce ischemic events. 9,10,28,29 1 B-R 11. In patients with STEMI treated with ﬁbrinolytic therapy who are not intended to undergo an invasive approach, fondaparinux is a recommended alternative to reduce ischemic events. 27,30 *At the time of diagnosis and prior to invasive coronary angiography if planned. †Adapted or ‡modiﬁed from the “2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization.”31 Rao et al JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2162 patients with high-risk NSTE-ACS in the OASIS-5 (Fifth Organization to Assess Strategies in Acute Ischemic Syndromes) trial. 5 Fondaparinux was similar to enoxaparin in the risk for ischemic events at 9 days, but it reduced major bleeding. About 40% of the pa- tients underwent PCI, and an increase was observed in the rate of guiding-catheter thrombus formation with fondaparinux (0.9% versus 0.3%) compared with enoxaparin. In NSTE-ACS, despite some data favoring the use of enoxaparin over UFH, 11 multiple meta- analyses have not demonstrated compelling superi- ority in ef ﬁcacy over UFH. 7,26,36 A meta-analysis comparing low-molecular-weight heparin to UFH in 12,171 patients with ACS without ST-segment eleva- tion across 5 randomized trials showed no signiﬁcant difference in death or MI (2.2% versus 2.3%) or in the risk of major bleeding. 36 3. For patients with ACS undergoing coronary revascu- larization (CABG or PCI), parenteral anticoagulation is indicated until revascularization. The premature discontinuation of anticoagulation is associated with a transient rebound increase in thrombin activity and activated protein C and the reactivation of ischemic events, 12,13 with the greatest risk for reinfarction in the ﬁrst 4 to 8 hours after the discontinuation of anticoagulation. 4. UFH has traditionally been the preferred anticoagu- lant to support PCI in patients with NSTE-ACS. Acti- vated clotting time is used to guide dosing during PCI.37 Although its pharmacokinetic effects are not always predictable, its anticoagulant effect is revers- ible with the administration of protamine. 5. Bivalirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor evaluated in both NSTE-ACS and STEMI that can be used to support PCI. In the BRIGHT- 4 (Bivalirudin with Pro- longed Full-Dose Infusion during PPCI versus Hepa- rin) trial, 15 which enrolled patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI using radial access (93%), bivalir- udin was compared with heparin monotherapy in an open-label design. The bivalirudin regimen used included the standard bolus and dosing (0.75 mg/kg, then 1.75 mg/kg per hour) plus a post-PCI infusion at the full dose (1.75 mg/kg per hour) for 2 to 4 hours. Bivalirudin with the full dose post-PCI infusion was superior to UFH in reducing the 30-day composite of all-cause death or BARC (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium) types 3-5 bleeding (4.39% versus 3.06%; P ¼ 0.007). 15 All-cause death was also reduced with bivalirudin (3.92% versus 2.96%; P ¼ 0.04), as well as 30-day stent thrombosis (0.37% versus 1.1%; P ¼ 0.0015). Based on these results, when bivalirudin is used to support PPCI for STEMI, a postprocedure 2- to 4-hour infusion at full dose is recommended. 15,38,39 6. Meta-analyses comparing bivalirudin versus UFH with or without glycoprotein IIb /IIIa inhibitors in patients with ACS demonstrate that bivalirudin is associated with a lower risk for major bleeding. 16,17,40 In the TABLE 10 Dosing of Parenteral Anticoagulation in ACS Drug Dosing UFH n Initial therapy: Loading dose 60 IU/kg (max 4,000 IU), with initial infusion12 IU/kg per h (max 1,000 IU/h) adjusted to therapeutic aPTT range of 60-80 s. n To support PCI: In patients who have received prior anticoagulant therapy, additional UFH as needed to achieve an ACT 250-300 s. In patients who have not received prior anticoagulant therapy, 70-100 U/kg initial bolus to achieve target ACT of 250-300 s. n With ﬁbrinolytic therapy: Loading dose 60 IU/kg (maximum 4,000 IU) with initial infusion 12 IU/kg per h (maximum 1,000 IU/h) adjusted to therapeutic aPTT range. Bivalirudin n To support PCI: 0.75 mg/kg bolus, 1.75 mg/kg per h IV infusion during the PCI procedure. n Post-PCI infusion for PPCI: 1.75 mg/kg per h for 2-4 h post-PCI. n In patients with CrCl <30 mL/min, reduced infusion to 1 mg/kg per h. Enoxaparin n Initial therapy: 1 mg/kg subcutaneous every 12 h. Reduce dose to 1 mg/kg per d subcutaneous if CrCl<30 mL/min. n To support PCI: For previous treatment with enoxaparin, if the last subcutaneous dose was administered 8-12 h earlier or if only 1 sub- cutaneous dose of enoxaparin has been administered, an IV dose of 0.3 mg of enoxaparin should be given. If the last dose was administered within the previous 8 h, no additional enoxaparin should be given. For patients who have not received prior anticoagulant therapy, 0.5-0.75 mg/kg IV bolus. n With ﬁbrinolytic therapy: If age <75 y, 30 mg IV bolus, followed in 15 min by 1 mg/kg subcutaneous every 12 h (maximum 100 mg for the ﬁrst 2 doses). If age$75 y: no bolus, 0.75 mg/kg subcutaneous every 12 h (maximum 75 mg for theﬁrst 2 doses). Regardless of age, if CrCl<30 mL/min: 1 mg/kg subcutaneous every 24 h. Fondaparinux n Initial therapy: 2.5 mg subcutaneous daily. n With ﬁbrinolytic therapy: 2.5 mg IV, then 2.5 mg subcutaneous daily starting the following day. Contraindicated if CrCl<30 mL/min. n Fondaparinux should not be used to support PCI because of the risk of catheter thrombosis.

Bivalirudin was also evaluated in the MATRIX (Mini- mizing Adverse Hemorrhag ic Events by Transradial Access Site and Systemic Implementation of AngioX) trial where it was compared against UFH alone (ie, without concomitant glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor). 42 No signiﬁcant difference was observed between the 2 arms with respect to 30-day ischemic or bleeding events. 7. Intravenous enoxaparin compared with UFH reduces the risk for ischemic outcomes without a signi ﬁcant difference in bleeding in the setting of PPCI. In the ATOLL (Acute Myocardial Infarction Treated with Primary Angioplasty and Intravenous Enoxaparin or Unfractionated Heparin to Lower Ischemic and Bleeding Events at Short- and Long-term Follow-up) trial, 24 which enrolled patients presenting with STEMI, the primary endpoint of 30-day incidence of death, complication of MI, procedural failure, or major bleeding occurred in 28% of patients with enoxaparin compared with 34% with UFH (P ¼ 0.06). Although the incidence of primary endpoint was not signi ﬁcantly different between enoxaparin and UFH, the secondary endpoint of 30-day death, recurrent ACS, or urgent revascularization was signi ﬁcantly lower in the enoxaparin group (7% versus 11%; P ¼ 0.015). In addition, a net clinical beneﬁt (death, complication of MI, or major bleeding) was observed with enoxaparin compared with UFH (10% versus 15%; P ¼ 0.03). In a meta-analysis of 10,451 patients, intravenous enox- aparin was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in death and major bleeding. 26 8. Fondaparinux should not be used as the sole antico- agulant to support PCI because of the risk of catheter thrombosis. 5,27,31 In the OASIS-5 trial, an increase was observed in the rate of catheter-related thrombus with fondaparinux compared with enoxaparin (0.9% versus 0.4%). 5 Similar results were observed in the OASIS-6 (The Safety and Ef ﬁcacy of Fondaparinux versus Control Therapy in Patients with STEMI) trial in which a higher rate of guiding-catheter thrombosis and more coronary complications with fondaparinux were observed when used during PCI. 27 9. In patients with STEMI treated withﬁbrinolytic ther- apy, parenteral anticoagulation is recommended before and after ﬁbrinolytic therapy to reduce ischemic events. In studies of ﬁbrinolytic therapy such as the GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptoki- nase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries) trial, t he ASSENT-3 (Assessment of the Safety and Ef ﬁcacy of a New Thrombolytic Regimen) trial, or the ExTRACT-TIMI 25 (Enoxaparin and Thrombolysis Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial Infarction Treatment-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 25) study, intravenous heparin was administered for at least 48 hours. 10,29,43 In the ExTRACT-TIMI 25 study, the UFH infusion was given for at least 48 hours but could be continued for a longer period at the treating physician ’s discretion, whereas the subcutaneous injections of enoxaparin were continued until hospital discharge or for a maximum of 8 days (whichever came ﬁrst). 10 Patients randomized to enoxaparin had a lower risk of death or nonfatal recurrent MI through 30 days compared with UFH (9.9% versus 12.0%); however, treatment with e noxaparin was associated with an increase in major bleeding (2.1% versus 1.4%). 10 10. In patients with STEMI who received ﬁbrinolytic therapy and who are not planned for an invasive approach, enoxaparin is the preferred anticoagulant over UFH. 9,10,28,29,44 In the ExTRACT-TIMI 25 study, enoxaparin until hospital discharge or for a maximum of 8 days (whichever came ﬁrst) was compared with UFH administered for at least 48 hours (could be continued for a longer period at the treating physi- cian’s discretion) in 20,506 patients with STEMI receiving ﬁbrinolytic therapy. 10 The primary endpoint o fd e a t ho rn o n f a t a lr e c u r r e n tM It h r o u g h3 0d a y s occurred in 12% in the UFH group compared with 9.9% in the enoxaparin group. In a meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials, UFH did not reduce reinfarction or death in patients treated with ﬁbrinolytic therapy. In contrast, low-molecular-weight heparin reduced the risk of reinfarction and death compared with placebo and the risk of reinfarction. 45 11. In patients with STEMI who are not likely to undergo an invasive approach, fondaparinux is an alternate anticoagulant that can be used. In the OASIS-6 trial of patients with STEMI who were treated with throm- bolytic agents (predominantly streptokinase), fonda- parinux signi ﬁcantly reduced the risk of the primary endpoint of death or reinfarction at 30 days, including as i g n iﬁcant reduction in mortality, reinfarction, and severe bleeding when compared with placebo or UFH. 27,30 Rao et al JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2164 4.5. Lipid Management Synopsis The current recommendations focus on patients with recent (ie, within 12 months) ACS. The 2023 AHA/ACC/ ACCP/ASPC/NLA/PCNA CCD guideline provides more detailed recommendations on long-term management of lipids in patients with prior ACS. 14 ASCVD event rates are substantially higher in patients with recent ACS than those with CCD, with 1-year rates of cardiovascular death, MI, and ischemic stroke estimated at 10% to 15% after an ACS hospitalization. 15,16 Higher risk among pa- tients with ACS supports more aggressive LDL- cholesterol (LDL-C) target si np a t i e n t sw i t hr e c e n tA C S c o m p a r e dw i t ht h o s ew i t hC C D(Figure 5). 14-16 RCTs have demonstrated ASCVD event reduction with multiple different pharmacological approaches to LDL-C level lowering, with the magnitude of bene ﬁt proportional to t h ed e g r e eo fL D L - Cl e v e ll o w e r i n g .17 In patients with ACS, RCTs have demonstrated incremental bene ﬁtw i t h high- compared with moderate-intensity statin therapy in regard to reduction in MACE. 1-4 For patients who do not reach LDL-C treatment goals on maximally tolerated statin therapy, or who are intolerant to statins, several nonstatin therapies, including ezetimibe, monoclonal antibodies to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), and bempedoic acid, can both lower LDL-C levels and improve ASCVD outcomes across diverse populations. 5-10 Inclisiran also lowers LDL-C levels by preventing translation of PCSK9 mRNA, but clinical outcomes studies are not yet available (Table 12). Nonetheless, the relative bene ﬁto fL D L - C–lowering therapies is expected to be proportional to the observed r e d u c t i o ni nL D L - Cl e v e l s(Tables 11 and 12 ). 5-11 A lipid proﬁle is recommended as soon as feasible after pre- sentation with ACS ( Figure 5 ), because LDL-C levels decrease modestly beginning 24 hours from symptom onset. 18 Lipid management after hospital discharge is discussed in Section 11.2 , “Reassessment of Lipid Levels Postdischarge. ” Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. High-intensity statin regimens lower LDL-C concen- t r a t i o nb ya na v e r a g eo f$50% (Table 11 ). The CTT (Cholesterol Treatment Tri alists) meta-analysis of 5 RCTs showed that LDL-C concentration lowering with high-intensity statins compared with moderate- intensity statins reduces major vascular events by approximately 15% in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). 4 An individual participant meta- analysis of the A to Z (Aggrastat to Zocor) and PROVE IT (Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infec- tion Therapy)-TIMI 22 trials, both of which were per- formed in patients stabilized early after ACS, demonstrated signi ﬁcant reductions in cardiovascular and all-cause death with more intensive versus less intensive statin regimens. 19 The bene ﬁto fah i g h - intensity statin regimen appears early after ACS and persists over time. 3 The beneﬁt of high-intensity sta- tins after ACS appears to be independent of baseline Recommendations for Lipid Management Referenced studies that support recommendations are summarized in the Evidence Table .

No indication was observed of any safety concerns from achieving very low LDL-C concentrations on statins or other lipid-lowering ther- apies; therefore, high-inten sity statin therapy should not be de-escalated during follow-up in patients who are tolerating treatment. 13 2.

Inclisiran lowers LDL-C levels by approximately 50% and is well tolerated, 26 but clinical outcome studies are not yet available. Bempedoic acid works upstream from statins in the liver and leads to approximately 20% reduction in LDL-C levels. It re- duces MACE by 13% in statin-intolerant patients when started >90 days after ACS. 10 3. Statin intolerance is frequent in clinical practice and the most commonly reported cause is statin-associated muscle symptoms. 27 To consider a patient as having statin intolerance, a minimum of 2 statins should be attempted, including at least 1 at the lowest approved daily dose. 28 Currently available options for patients with complete or partial intolerance to statin therapy include ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitor monoclonal anti- bodies, inclisiran, and bempedoic acid. Ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors have been demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated and improve lipid parameters in statin-intolerant patients. 8,9 However, outcomes s t u d i e su s i n gt h e s ea g e n t sa sm o n o t h e r a p yo ri nc o m - bination in statin-intolerant patients are not available. Bempedoic acid is an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor that reduces LDL-C levels by 15% to 25% with low rates of muscle-related adverse effects. 29,30 A combination product that combines bempedoic acid with ezetimibe lowered LDL-C levels by approximately 35%. 31 In the CLEAR Outcomes (Cholesterol Lowering via Bempe- doic Acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen) trial, bempedoic acid was compared with placebo in statin-intolerant patients with or at high risk for ASCVD. Patients with ACS within 90 days prior to randomization were excluded from this trial. Mean LDL-C level was 139 mg/dL at enrollment and was reduced by 29 mg/dL with bempedoic acid compared with placebo. MACE was reduced by 13% in the bempedoic acid arm.

Beta-Blocker Therapy Synopsis Beta blockers decrease myocardial oxygen demand by reducing the heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial contractility. 1,3 The clinical bene ﬁt of beta blockers in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40% and stabilized HF is well established, including patients post-MI. 3-5 Most of the RCT data per- taining to early use of beta-blocker therapy in STEMI were conducted in the pre-reperfusion era. 3 No adequately powered RCTs have been done that examine the clinical beneﬁt of beta blockers during hospitalization among patients exclusively wit h NSTE-ACS. Although most studies were conducted in pa tients with STEMI, early hospital initiation of beta-blocker therapy (within 24 hours) is recommended among most patients with ACS and without contraindications (eg, acute HF [Killip class II-IV], evidence of low cardiac output state or at risk for cardiogenic shock, PR interval >0.24 milliseconds, sec- ond- or third-degree heart block without a cardiac pace- maker, severe bradycardia, active bronchospasm). 1,2,6 Patients with an initial contraindication to beta-blocker therapy on presentation can be reassessed after 24 hours and initiated on oral beta-blocker therapy if the initial contraindication has resolved. Further study is warranted to examine the beneﬁt in those patients with NSTE-ACS. Although an open-label randomized trial has raised questions about the bene ﬁt of long-term beta-blocker therapy following hospital discharge in patients with ACS who have undergone coronary revascularization and have preserved left ventricular (LV) function, 7 this area re- mains under study. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. RCTs from both the pre-reperfusion era and in the early reperfusion era have shown that early initiation of beta-blocker therapy reduces the risk of reinfarction and ventricular arrhythmias among patients with STEMI. 1-3 The COMMIT (Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in Myocardial Infarction) trial included 45,852 patients (approximately 50% received ﬁbrinolytic therapy and 7% having NSTE-ACS) and showed that early initiation of high doses (ie, up to 15 mg intravenously then 200 mg orally daily) of metoprolol reduced the risk of reinfarction an dv e n t r i c u l a rﬁbrillation compared with placebo but increased the risk of cardiogenic shock that occurred mainly during the ﬁrst 24 hours. 1 In a small open-label trial of 801 patients with STEMI who un- derwent PPCI, carvedilol did not reduce MACE over 3 years, but the trial was underpowered to detect a dif- ference. 8 Overall, the weight of the evidence suggests that a low dose of oral beta blocker should be initiated in patients without contraindication early after diag- nosis of ACS (<24 hours) with slow dose escalation as b l o o dp r e s s u r ea n dh e a r tr a t ep e r m i t .U s es h o u l db e discontinued in those with new or worsening HF symptoms or signs of cardiogenic shock. In hemody- namically stable patients with STEMI who do not have acute HF, intravenous beta blockers can be adminis- tered prior to reperfusion if there are ongoing symp- toms or a clinical indication for administration. The weight of the evidence does not support the routine use of intravenous beta blocker s prior to PPCI because of inconsistent results as to whether it has any favorable effect on infarct size or clinical outcomes. 9,10 The optimal duration of beta-blocker use remains unclear in patients with preserved LVEF. Although a randomized trial did not conﬁrm long-term beneﬁt from continued use of a beta blocker after hospital discharge in lower risk patients with preserved LV function who had un- dergone coronary revascularization, 7 additional studies are ongoing in this space.

Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors Synopsis Oral ACE inhibitors reduce all-cause death and MACE in patients with STEMI or NSTEMI, particularly when associated with high-risk features (LVEF #40%, hyper- tension, diabetes mellitus, or STEMI with anterior location). 1-4,6 Even in AMI without high-risk features, use of an oral ACEi confers a modest survival bene ﬁt.4 Compared with ACEi, the beneﬁts of an ARB in patients with AMI with HF or LV systolic dysfunction are similar. 5 Thus, in the absence of contraindications, either an oral ACEi or ARB should be initiated in appropriate patients with AMI. 5,8 In patients with AMI with LVEF #4 0 % ,a n dw i t hH Fs y m p t o m sa n d / o rd i a - betes mellitus, the addition of a mineralocorticoid re- ceptor antagonist reduced all-cause death and MACE and should be given in the absence of advanced chronic kidney disease, hyperkalemia, or other contraindication. In patients with symptomatic HF and reduced LVEF, sacubitril-valsartan has been demonstrated to be superior to an ACEi for reducing cardiovascular death or HF hos- pitalization; however, the trial excluded patients within 3 months of ACS. 9 In a trial of patients early after MI with LVEF #40% and/or pulmonary congestion, sacubitril- valsartan did not signi ﬁcantly reduce cardiovascular d e a t ho ri n c i d e n tH Fc o m p a r e dw i t ha nA C E i .H y p o t e n - sive events were more common with sacubitril-valsartan, but no other safety concerns were observed. Therefore, if treatment with sacubitril-valsartan for HF with reduced ejection fraction is planned, initiation of this combination agent instead of an ACEi or ARB early after MI appears safe. 10 Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a reduction in all-cause death and MACE with the addi- tion of an oral ACEi in patients with AMI with LVEF #40% 1,3 and in patients with anterior STEMI.2 An individual-patient meta-analysis of 98,496 patients with AMI also showed a survival beneﬁtw i t hA C E iu s e , with the greatest absolute beneﬁt in patients with hy- pertension, diabetes, and STEMI of anterior location. 4 In the VALIANT (Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial of patien ts with AMI with LV systolic dysfunction and/or HF symptoms, the use of an ARB was statistically noninferior to an ACEi, and rates of all- cause death were similar between the 2 treatment arms. 5 Concomitant initiation of both an ACEi and ARB in patients with AMI should be avoided due to an in- crease in adverse events without added bene ﬁt c o m p a r e dw i t he i t h e rd r u ga l o n e .5,8 2. In the EPHESUS (Eplerenon eP o s t - A c u t eM y o c a r d i a l Infarction Heart Failure Ef ﬁcacy and Survival Study) trial, the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone reduced both all-cause death and MACE during a mean follow-up of 16 months in patients with AMI with LVEF #40% who also had symptoms of HF and/or diabetes mellitus. The use of evidence- based therapies for this population was relatively high, including 86% use of ACEi or ARB and 75% use of a beta blocker at enrollment. 7 Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL) or hyperkalemia (serum potassium >5.0 mmol/L) were excluded from enrollment. 7 In a trial of 1,012 patients with acute STEMI and without a history of HF, the use of eplerenone reduced the primary endpoint compared with placebo, but the beneﬁt was largely driven by a reduction in natri- uretic peptides. 11 Recommendations for Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors Referenced studies that support recommendations are summarized in the Evidence Table .

STEMI MANAGEMENT: REPERFUSION STRATEGIES 5.1. Regional Systems of STEMI Care Synopsis The goal of optimizing outcomes after STEMI depends not only on the ef ﬁcient execution of STEMI care pro- cesses but also on the seamless communication and coordination of care among the teams caring for the patient. The goal of each community is therefore to ensure a coordinated response to every patient with STEMI, regardless of physical location at presentation, to help minimize total ischemic time. The creation and maintenance of successful systems of STEMI care require detailed mapping of care for all possible routes by which a patient with S TEMI could present for diagnosis and receive de ﬁnitive reperfusion therapy at both PCI-capable and non –PCI-capable facilities, as well as access to cardiac surgical care and other advanced care modalities ( Figure 6 ). The many stakeholders of regional systems of STEMI care (including hospitals, EMS companies, regional public health departments, and local governments) must ensure that all components of a STEMI system of care function in a coordinated way with no gaps in care processes to help optimize STEMI outcomes in the community. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. The establishment of coord inated regional systems of STEMI care is associated with reduced time to reperfusion and increased survival in STEMI in several pre- versus postimplementation comparison studies throughout the world. 1-6 Over the past 15 years, considerable gains have been made in reducing FMC to reperfusion times in patients with STEMI and these improvements in reperfusion times have been associated with improved outcomes. 5,7 Unfortunately, recent declines have been reported in the rates of achieving established STEMI perfor- mance measures, 8 in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related challenges in ensuring adequate resourcing and staf ﬁng of EMS agencies and hospitals. Therefore , all communities should continue to establish, reinvigorate, and maintain regional systems of STEMI care to improve outcomes of patients with STEMI globally. The collection of high-quality data at every stage of care is an insep- arable component of a STEMI system of care. Suc- cessful STEMI systems have robust mechanisms for: 1) educating the public of the need to immediately call 9-1-1 (or other appropriate local emergency ser- vices) for ischemic symptoms and not driving them- selves to the nearest hospital; 2) data collection that balances the need for adequate data capture without introducing data overburden; 3) data sharing within hospital departments (eg, ED and cardiology) or be- tween hospitals and EMS agencies; and 4) meetings to review and discuss shared data at local and sys- tem levels to drive process improvement.

PPCI in STEMI Synopsis Timely PPCI confers improved survival compared with ﬁbrinolytic therapy as primary reperfusion therapy for patients with STEMI. 6,7 Systems of care designed to reduce the time to PPCI for patients with STEMI have been consequential in reducing risk of early death. 19,20 T h eg o a li st op r o v i d eP P C Ia ss o o na sp o s s i b l ea f t e rt h e diagnosis of STEMI is made with ﬁrst device activation within 90 minutes from FMC among walk-in and EMS- transported patients and 120 minutes for transfer pa- tients from non –PCI-capable facilities. 1-7 The bene ﬁto f PPCI begins to diminish for those >12 hours from symp- tom onset, but there appears to be continued beneﬁtf o r PPCI through appro ximately 24 hours. 12,13 In stable asymptomatic patients with an occluded artery>48 hours after symptom onset, routine PCI has not been shown to be bene ﬁcial in the absence of ongoing ischemia; the relative utility of routine PCI for asymptomatic patients with STEMI between 24 to 48 hours from symptom onset is less rigorously tested. 14,15 However, coronary revascu- larization should be considered for patients with late presentations with continued signs and symptoms of ischemia, including cardiogenic shock, acute severe HF, persistent angina, and life-threatening arrhythmias. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. PPCI is the recommended reperfusion therapy in pa- tients with STEMI and ischemic symptoms when performed #90 minutes (FMC –to–ﬁrst-device activa- tion) or #120 minutes in transfer patients to improve survival. 1-7 The success of PPCI in achieving these goals was facilitated by the introduction in 2006 of the AHA’s Mission: Lifeline programs involving EMS and clinicians (eg, emergency medicine, cardiology, nursing) with practiced drill-down programs and regionalization of care 21 that have improved myocar- dial salvage, as well as reduced risk of death and adverse outcomes. 4,22,23 PPCI is superior toﬁbrinolytic t h e r a p y ,w h i c hi su s e dw h e nt h ep a t i e n ti si nan o n– PCI-capable hospital and transfer time to a PCI-capable hospital is anticipated to be >120 minutes. Compared with ﬁbrinolytic therapy with a similar treatment delay, PPCI offers higher rates of infarct-related artery patency, and restoring TIMI 3 epicardialﬂow grade, as well as lower rates of recurrent ischemia, reinfarction, emergency repeat revascularization procedures, intra- cranial hemorrhage, and death. 6,7 Radial access for PPCI has further reduced death, decreased access site bleeding, decreased the need for transfusion, and reduced acute kidney injury when compared with femoral access (Section 7.1, “Vascular Access Approach for PCI”). 24,25 2.

Among the patients randomized to revascularization, 64% of patients were referred for PCI and 36% for CABG surgery. The median time from randomization to revascularization was 0.9 hours for PCI and 2.7 hours for CABG surgery. Despite lack of a signiﬁcant difference in the primary endpoint of mortality at 30 days, emergency revascularization with either PCI or CABG surgery reduced mortality at 6 months, 9 and the mortality rate bene ﬁtw a sm a i n - tained through 1 and 6 years.26,27 In an observational analysis from the FITT-STEMI (Feedback Intervention and Treatment Times in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) trial, for every 10-minute delay in PPCI after 60 minutes from FMC, there were an additional 3 to 4 deaths per 100 with>8 0 %m o r t a l i t yb e y o n d6h o u r so f delay from FMC for patients with cardiogenic shock. 8 Therefore, it is recommended that PPCI should be performed in patients with STEMI and cardiogenic shock as soon as possible, ideally within 90 minutes, to reduce the mortality rate. Observational studies sug- gest that emergency CABG surgery remains a treatment option in patients with cardiogenic shock who are not amenable to primary reperfusion with PCI 10,11 or when PCI is not successful.11,28 3. The beneﬁt of PCI for asymptomatic patients present- ing 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset is not well studied. Small randomized trials of patients 12 to 48 hours after symptom onset in STEMI have demon- strated that PPCI reduces infarct size and improves the LVEF. 12,14 These ﬁndings are further supported by observational data. 13,15 4. No dedicated trials have been done that examine the beneﬁt of PPCI in patients with STEMI presenting late >24 hours after symptom onset who have clinical evi- dence of ongoing ischemia, acute severe HF, or life- threatening arrhythmias. Observational data and small trials suggest that PCI in patients with STEMI with delayed presentations is reasonable and is asso- ciated with improved outcomes. 12,14,15 5. PCI is not recommended for an occluded infarct- related artery if the patient is asymptomatic and has a completed infarct. MACE outcomes were similar in those with an occluded infar ct-related artery versus those who underwent PCI 3 to 28 days after an MI (Occluded Artery Trial [OAT]) 16 and results were no different at 7 years follow-up.29 Similar ﬁndings were n o t e di nt h eD E C O P I( D e s o b s t r u c t i o nC o r o n a i r ee n Post-Infarctus) trial, which enrolled patients with an occluded artery and Q waves on the ECG presenting 2 to 15 days after symptom onset. 17 5.2.2. Urgent CABG Surgery Synopsis Trials that evaluated the ef ﬁcacy and safety of CABG surgery in STEMI are limited.4 When PCI is not possible for anatomic reasons or in the presence of complex disease, CABG surgery can be performed as the primary reperfusion strategy. After successful reperfusion of the infarct-related artery, CABG surgery can also be important when managing patients with more extensive noninfarct-related artery disease ( Section 7.4.1 , “Man- agement of Multivessel CAD in STEMI ”). The appro- priate timing of CABG surgery in patients with STEMI should be determined on an individual basis, taking into consideration the hemodynamic stability of the patient, the presence of ongoing ischemia, and extent of myocardium at risk. After failed PPCI, emergency CABG surgery is not recommended in the absence of a large area of myocardium at risk or if surgical targets are poor and if surgery may be associated with an increased risk of death and adverse cardiovascular outcomes compared with nonsurgical management. 5 For recommendations regarding CABG surgery in patients presenting with cardiogenic shock or mechanical com- plications, please refer to Section 8.1 , “Revasculariza- tion in ACS With Cardiogenic Shock ” and Section 9.1 , “Mechanical Complications. ” Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1.

In such patients, particularly in the presence of ongoing ischemia or if a large area of myocardium is at risk, CABG surgery may be effectively performed as a primary reperfusion strategy or after PPCI. 1,2 D e s p i t ea ni n c r e a s ei nt h ea c u i t yo fp r e s e n t a - tion and the burden of comorbidities, the in-hospital mortality rate after CABG surgery in patients with STEMI continues to decrease. 1,4 5.3. Reperfusion at Non–PCI-Capable Hospitals Synopsis A large proportion of patients globally live >1h o u r driving time to a PCI-capable hospital. 14-17 At non–PCI- capable hospitals, transfer for PPCI is recommended if device activation can be rea sonably predicted to occur in <2 hours from FMC. If this cannot be achieved and symptoms have been present <12 hours, ﬁbrinolytic therapy is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent MACE. Patients with STEMI who present to a non –PCI- capable facility $12 hours after onset of symptoms should be transferred to a PCI-capable facility when possible. However, if the patient has associated hemodynamic instability or a large infarct territory at risk, they are at very high risk for morbidity and death, and in this situa- tion where timely PPCI is not possible, the bene ﬁts of ﬁbrinolytic administration likely outweigh the bene ﬁto f prolonged transfer for PPCI. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. PPCI is recommended to reduce the risk of MACE when FMC to PPCI can be achieved within 120 minutes. A patient who presents to a non –PCI-capable hospital with STEMI should be transferred to a PCI-capable hospital when this intervention can be accomplished within 120 minutes. 1,2,18 System delays related to transfer are frequently underestimated, and a case-by- case approach should be calculated for each patient with STEMI prior to transfer for PPCI.19-21 2. The use ofﬁbrinolytic therapy in STEMI in the United States is driven by patients who are unable to receive timely PPCI (<120 minutes FMC to device activation). Numerous RCTs and meta-analyses have demonstrated superiority to PPCI over ﬁbrinolytic therapy. However, the bene ﬁts of PPCI versus ﬁbrinolytic therapy diminish with increasing PCI-related time delay such that after 120 minutes, the bene ﬁts are no longer as clear when compared with more timely ﬁbrinolytic therapy administration. 19 In these patients, when timely PPCI cannot be performed, meta-analyses of RCTs and observational studies show statistically similar morbidity and mortality rates for a pharmaco- invasive approach (eg, ﬁbrinolytic therapy followed by PCI within 2 to 24 hours) when a patient does not have timely access to PPCI. 4,5 The STREAM (Strategic Reperfusion Early After Myocardial Infarction) trial, which randomized 1,892 early presenters (symptoms <3 hours) with STEMI unable to receive PCI within 1 hour of FMC, found that both a 30-day composite (eg, death, shock, CHF, or reinfarction) and 1-year mortality rates were similar for prehospital ﬁbrino- lysis versus transfer for PPCI. 10,22 3. Small studies suggest that PPCI continues to offer clinical bene ﬁt in patients 12 to 24 hours after symp- toms onset; therefore, transfer to a PCI-capable hos- pital is reasonable. 11,12 Late presenters with STEMI who have associated hemodynamic instability or large infarct size are at very high risk for acute deterioration Recommendations for Reperfusion at Non –PCI-Capable Hospitals Referenced studies that support recommendations are summarized in the Evidence Table .

In this situation, ﬁbrinolytic administration may outweigh potential risks when timely PPCI is not possible. Fibrinolysis in this setting should be followed by transfer to a PCI-capable center as soon as feasible. 4. There is no beneﬁto fﬁbrinolysis and there is potential harm (eg, hemorrhagic stroke and major noncerebral bleeding) in administering ﬁbrinolytic therapy to pa- tients who present with symptoms concerning for ACS without ST-segment elevation or suspected true pos- terior STEMI. 13 5.3.1.

In instances where this is not possible or cannot be achieved in a timely manner, the beneﬁts of coronary reperfusion with ﬁbrinolytic therapy in patients with STEMI are well established, with a time-dependent reduction in both mortality and morbidity rates during the initial 12 hours after symptom onset, especially in those who present early after symptom onset with low bleeding risk and large anterior infarctions. 1-7 The bene ﬁto f ﬁbrinolytic therapy in patients who present>12 hours after symptom onset has not been established, 8-10 although consider- ation should be given to administering aﬁbrinolytic agent in symptomatic patients presenting >12 hours after symptom onset of STEMI with a large area of myocardium at risk or hemodynamic instability, if PCI is unavailable. Fibrin-speci ﬁc ﬁbrinolytic therapies are preferred over non–ﬁbrin-speci ﬁc agents due to superior patency rates and less immunogenicity (Table 13). 11-16 Tenecteplase is a genetically engineered version of alteplase with higher speci ﬁcity for ﬁbrin. In a large randomized trial of pa- tients with AMI, tenecteplase and alteplase were equiva- lent for 30-day mortality rates, but tenecteplase was associated with reduced noncerebral bleeding. 17 Reteplase (recombinant plasminogen activator) has not been shown to improve survival compared with alteplase in patients with MI, but its convenient bolus dosing al- lows for greater ease of use. 18 Adjunctive antiplatelet and/ or anticoagulant therapies are indicated, regardless of the choice of ﬁbrinolytic agent ( Sections 4.3.2 ., “Oral P2Y12 Inhibitors During Hospitalization, ” and 4.4, “Parenteral Anticoagulation ”). Absolute and relative contraindica- tions for ﬁbrinolytic therapy are listed in Table 14. Patients should be transferred to a PCI-capable hospital after initiation of ﬁbrinolytic therapy for routine coronary angiography ( Section 5.3.2 ., “Coronary Angiography and PCI After Fibrinolytic Therapy ”). Signs of failed reperfu- sion are discussed in Section 5.3.2.

Coronary Angiography and PCI After Fibrinolytic Therapy Synopsis Failure of reperfusion and risk of reocclusion after successful ﬁbrinolytic therapy are important limitations of ﬁbrinolytic therapy. For this reason, all patients receiving ﬁbrinolytic therapy should be transferred to a PCI-capable hospital to facilitate immediate or early catheterization depending on the clinical circumstances. Hospitals should have transfer protocols in place to allow for a seamless transfer to the PCI-capable facility as soon as it is safe to do so. A detailed assessment of clinical status is critical to determine the timing of angiography. A lack of improvement in ischemic symptoms, persistent ST-segment elevation ( <50% resolution of ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads or <70% in inferior leads [measured either from the lead with maximal baseline ST elevation or as the sum of ST-segment deviation across leads]), 13 or hemodynamic or electrical instability can indicate incomplete reperfusion by ﬁbrinolytic therapy. 14 When there are signs of failed reperfusion, patients should undergo immediate coronary angiography and rescue PCI. For the remaining patients, routine coronary angiography within 2 to 24 hours after ﬁbrinolytic therapy with coronary revascularization as needed is recommended. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Numerous clinical trials have evaluated a strategy of early coronary angiography with possible PCI after ﬁbrinolytic therapy. This strategy of immediate trans- fer and angiography has been associated with lower rates of recurrent ischemic events as compared with usual care. 1-5 Regardless of the timing of angiography, immediate transfer enables earlier access to specialized centers, providing critical care services and on-site catheterization laboratory teams that can facilitate clinical assessments to determine the likelihood of reperfusion and enable earlier angiography for the unstable patient. 2. Rescue PCI is associated with improved outcomes in patients with clinical signs of failed reperfusion after ﬁbrinolytic therapy. Severa l trials have demonstrated a t r e n dt o w a r dl o w e rm o r t a l i t ya n ds i g n iﬁcantly lower rates of recurrent MI and HF when rescue PCI is per- formed for failed ﬁbrinolysis. 6,7 The REACT (Rapid Early Action for Coronary Treatment) trial 6 enrolled 427 patients with failed reperfusion at 90 minutes after ﬁbrinolysis to 1 of 3 treatment arms, including rescue PCI, conservative care, or repeat ﬁbrinolytic therapy. Rescue PCI signi ﬁcantly reduced the composite pri- mary endpoint of death, reinfarction, stroke, or severe HF at 6 months compared with either conservative care or repeat ﬁbrinolytic therapy. Meta-analyses also sup- port lower rates of death or reinfarction when rescue PCI is performed in this setting. 8,9 Minor and major bleeding and rates of stroke were signiﬁcantly higher with rescue PCI. 6-8 These studies were performed in the era of femoral artery access, with fewer options for antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy. The use of radial artery access 15 and the elimination of the routine use of glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa inhibitors has reduced bleeding. For this reason, the balance of beneﬁtf r o m rescue PCI outweighs the risks for most patients with evidence of failed reperfusion after ﬁbrinolysis. 3. Routine early angiography with the intent to perform PCI after ﬁbrinolysis reduces MACE in comparison to usual care (delayed coronary angiography and/or an ischemia-guided strategy of revascularization). 1-5,11,16 In these studies, >80% of patients who were trans- ferred underwent PCI to treat a signi ﬁcant residual stenosis or suboptimal ﬂow of the infarct-related ar- tery.

NSTE-ACS: ROUTINE INVASIVE OR SELECTIVE INVASIVE INITIAL APPROACH 6.1. Rationale and Timing for a Routine Invasive or Selective Invasive Approach Synopsis A routine invasive approach refers to a strategy of performing coronary angiography with the intent to perform coronary revascularization by PCI or CABG (as appropriate) in patients with NSTE-ACS. This approach provides important prognostic information, including delineating the extent and severity of CAD. Several RCTs have demonstrated that a routine invasive approach in patients with NSTE-ACS reduces the risk of MACE when compared with a selective invasive approach. 1-3 Notably, these strategy trials were conducted in an era prior to the availability of hs-cTn assays, routine use of radial approach for coronary angiography, newer generation drug-eluting stents, and contemporary evidence-based antiplatelet therapies. Pati ents who are at prohibitively high risk from angiography or who have known coronary anatomy or preferences that preclude revascularization (PCI or CABG) may be managed noninvasively. 13 In addi- tion, some low-risk patients, particularly those who have normal cardiac biomarkers and in whom a diagnosis of an ACS is questioned, should be considered for a “selective invasive ” approach that includes further noninvasive risk strati ﬁcation prior to considera tion of coronary angiog- raphy, because they derive less bene ﬁt from a routine Recommendations for Rationale and Timing for a Routine Invasive or Selective Invasive Approach Referenced studies that support recommendations are summarized in the Evidence Table . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS Routine Invasive Versus Selective Invasive Strategy 1A 1.

Patients with higher risk ﬁndings on noninvasive testing or who have recurrent ischemic symptoms should be referred for invasive coronary angiograph y prior to hospital discharge in the absence of contraindication (Figure 7). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In patients with NSTE-ACS, a routine invasive approach improves clinical outcomes, including lower rates of recurrent MI and recurrent ischemia, compared with a selective invasive approach that involves further noninvasive risk strati ﬁcation prior to consid- eration of angiography. 1-3 In a collaborative meta- analysis of RCTs, a routine invasive approach reduced death or MI by 18% (OR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.72-0.93]), including a 25% reduction in MI (OR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.65-0.88]) when compared with a selective invasive approach. 5 The beneﬁt was more apparent in higher risk patients with elevated biomarkers. 4 The studies that established the bene ﬁt of a routine invasive approach were conducted in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and it is unknown whether contemporary FIGURE 7 Selection of a Routine Invasive Versus Selected Invasive Strategy in Patients With NSTE-ACS Colors correspond to Class of Recommendation inTable 2. *AHA Scientiﬁc Statement on MINOCA.17 CABG indicates coronary artery bypass grafting; CCTA, cardiac CT angiography; MINOCA, myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary artery disease; NSTE-ACS, non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes; and PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.

Similarly, elevated car- diac biomarkers (CK-MB and older generation troponin assays) identify those who beneﬁt more from a routine invasive strategy; however, it remains unknown whether hs-cTn assays that detect smaller degrees of myonecrosis are as useful for identifying those who beneﬁt from routine coronary angiography. Although women are less likely to have obstructive coronary disease at angiography, they derive as much bene ﬁt from a routine invasive approach in the presence of similar risk predictors. 4 The GRACE 2.0 risk calculator and TIMI Risk Score for unstable angina/NSTEMI may help identify patients at increased risk of MACE who beneﬁt more from a routine invasive approach (Table 5 ). 1 Relative contraindications to coronary angiography that merit furt her consideration of the relative risks and bene ﬁts of a routine invasive approach are outlined in Table 15. 2. Although some trials have demonstrated a reduction in MACE with a routine invasive approach in NSTE- ACS, 1-3 others have not demonstrated a signi ﬁcant beneﬁt when compared with a selective approach that involves further risk strati ﬁcation. 4,7 Although a pooled analysis of 3 randomized trials suggested that the beneﬁt of a routine invasive approach was inde- pendent of baseline risk, 6 other meta-analyses across studies have suggested that lower risk patients may derive less beneﬁt.4,5,14 In addition, some low-risk pa- tients, particularly those who have normal cardiac biomarkers in whom a diagnosis of an ACS is suspect, may have improved outcomes with a selective invasive approach. 4,5 These patients should preferentially un- dergo noninvasive stress testing or coronary CT angi- ography prior to hospital discharge to help determine the need for coronary angiography; however, patients with suspected ongoing ischemic symptoms should be considered for coronary angiography. 3. Patients with NSTE-ACS who are unstable (eg, re- fractory or recurrent angina [despite optimal medical therapy, hemodynamic or electrical instability, acute pulmonary edema or HF, worsening mitral regurgita- tion]) have been largely excluded from RCTs. Despite a relative paucity of clinical trial data, these patients are at heightened risk of adverse outcomes, and an im- m e d i a t ei n v a s i v es t r a t e g y(<2h o u r sf r o mh o s p i t a l admission) with intention to perform revascularization is recommended. 8,15 If patients with ACS and unstable features are at a non–PCI-capable hospital, they should be immediately transferred to a PCI-capable facility with a goal of immediate angiography. Clinical features that support immediate coronary angiography with intent to revascularize are listed inFigure 8. 4. For patients with NSTE-ACS for whom the decision has been made to proceed with coronary angiography, the beneﬁt of an early invasive versus a delayed invasive approach is unclear. 8,9,11,12 In the TIMACS (Timing of Intervention in Acute Coronary Syndromes) trial, 11 patients were enrolled within 24 hours of symptoms and randomized to early angiography within 24 hours versus delayed angiography $36 hours from time of randomization. In the VERDICT (Very Early vs Deferred Invasive Evaluation Using Computerized Tomography) trial, 12 patients were randomized to early angiography within 12 hours versus delayed between 48 to 72 hours from time of diagnosis. Both studies reported no sig- niﬁcant difference in MACE between an earlier versus delayed invasive approach in the overall study pop- ulations, but there was si gnal toward a reduction in MACE with an earlier invasive approach in the higher risk patients with a GRACE risk score >140. 11,12 In a meta-analysis of RCTs that compared an early versus delayed approach, a mortality bene ﬁtw a sn o ts e e n with earlier angiography. However, factors that favored an earlier invasive approach included a GRACE risk score >140, diabetes, age >75 years, and elevated cardiac biomarkers (althou gh formal tests for interac- tion were not signiﬁcant). 8 Although not evaluated in RCTs, a continuing steep rise in cardiac biomarkers, likely due to ongoing ischemia and myonecrosis despite optimized medical therapy, may also favor earlier coronary angiography. 5. In intermediate- or low-risk patients for whom angi- ography is planned in NSTE-ACS, timing does not appear to be critical, and a delayed invasive strategy within 48 to 72 hours does not appear to increase future risk of MACE. 8,10-12 ,15 Randomized trial data have not demonstrated an overall signi ﬁcant differ- ence in death or MI between an earlier versus delayed invasive approach in nonselected patients with NSTEMI. 8,11,12,16 TABLE 15 Relative Contraindications for a Routine Invasive Approach in ACS n High risk for bleeding on DAPT n Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 /C2 109/L) n Advanced kidney disease (not on dialysis) n Acute renal failure n Limited (<1-2 y) life expectancy n Advanced dementia n Known coronary anatomy that precludes PCI and/or CABG surgery n Patient preference ACS indicates acute coronary syndromes; CABG, coronary artery bypass grafting; DAPT, dual antiplatelet therapy; and PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.

Although the radial artery is the most widely studied wrist access site, the use of alternative sites in the upper extremity, including the ulnar and distal radial arteries have yielded similar FIGURE 8 Selection and Timing of an Invasive Strategy in NSTE-ACS Figure 8summarizes the recommendations in the 2025 ACS Guideline for a routine or selective invasive approach in NSTE-ACS.

Recommendation for Vascular Access Approach for PCI Referenced studies that support recommendation are summarized in the Evidence Table . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1A 1. In patients with ACS undergoing PCI, a radial approach is preferred to a femoral approach to reduce bleeding, vascular complications, and death.* 1-6 *Modiﬁed from the “2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization.”7 Rao et al JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2180 outcomes. 11,12 Transfemoral access, preferably with the use of ultrasound guidance, should be considered in pa- tients in whom temporary MCS is planned and is the default alternative access site among patients in whom the radial artery cannot be used due to clinical, anatom- ical, or technical reasons. 13 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. RCTs have consistently demonstrated the bene ﬁto f radial access in comparison with femoral access among patients treated for ACS. A meta-analysis using indi- vidual patient data from 7 high-quality RCTs (48.6% with NSTE-ACS; 46.2% with STEMI) demonstrated that radial access was independently associated with a sig- niﬁc a n t2 4 %a n d5 1 %r e l a t i v er i s kr e d u c t i o no fa l l - c a u s e death and major bleeding, respectively, when compared with femoral access. 3 The magnitude of the mortality bene ﬁt was greater among patients with lower baseline hemoglobin levels. The beneﬁto fr a d i a l access toward reducing bleeding was driven by a sig- niﬁcant reduction in access-site bleeding. Vascular complications were signi ﬁcantly reduced by 62%. The MATRIX trial 6 demonstrated a signi ﬁcantly lower rate of the coprimary endpoints of MACE and net adverse clinical events (composites of death, MI, and stroke at 30 days, and MACE plus non-CABG major bleeding) among patients with ACS randomized to the transradial approach compared with the transfemoral approach. This is consistent with prior meta-analyses that have reported lower mortality and bleeding with radial ac- cess in patients with ACS. 4,14 The SAFARI-STEMI (Safety and Ef ﬁcacy of Femoral Access versus Radial for Primary Percutaneous Intervention in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) trial showed no difference in 30-day mortality rates between radial and femoral ac- cess; however, the trial stopped early and therefore was underpowered to detect a mortality beneﬁt. 15 7.2. Use of Aspiration Thrombectomy Synopsis Despite restoration of coro nary patency, suboptimal myocardial perfusion resulting from distal embolization or microvascular obstruction is frequent and is associated with larger infarct size, impairment of LV function, and excess mortality rates. 6,7 Removing coronary artery thrombus prior to balloon angioplasty, stent deployment, or both is an intuitive adjunct to PPCI that may yield putative clinical bene ﬁts. Routine manual thrombus aspiration performed via low pro ﬁle catheters improved electrocardiographic and angiographic markers of m y o c a r d i a lp e r f u s i o ni nseveral clinical studies 8,9 and reduced adverse events in a single-center trial.10,11 How- ever, subsequent trials of manual aspiration thrombec- tomy have not demonstrated a clinical bene ﬁt.1,2,4,12,13 Similarly, results from a po oled analysis showed that mechanical thrombectomy during STEMI was not superior to conventional PCI alone. Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. Results from several RCTs have shown that routine manual aspiration thrombectomy prior to PCI does not reduce MI size or improve clinical outcomes as compared with PCI alone. 1,2,4,12,13 In a patient-level, pooled analysis comprising 3 RCTs, aspiration throm- bectomy did not reduce the primary endpoint of car- diovascular death at 30 days among patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI (n ¼ 18,306). 3 Similarly, aspi- ration thrombectomy did not lower risks for recurrent MI, target vessel revascularization, stent thrombosis, or HF at 30 days or 1 year. With respect to safety, the incidence of stroke or transient ischemic attack at 30 days and 1 year was numerically higher, albeit not statistically signi ﬁcant, among patients who underwent aspiration thrombectomy. Reductions in cardiovascular death were lower while risks for stroke or transient ischemic attack were higher among those with a large thrombus burden treated with aspiration thrombectomy. Dedicated studies are warranted to evaluate the role of selective aspiration thrombectomy in those high-risk patients most likely to beneﬁtf r o m thrombus removal prior to PCI. Manual aspiration thrombectomy may be performed as a bailout proced- ure to remove thrombus that persists after balloon angioplasty or stent deployment, particularly with concomitant no-re ﬂow. Estimates from RCT cohorts indicate that 4% to 7% of patients with STEMI under- going PPCI will require bailout aspiration thrombectomy. 1,2,10 Recommendation for Use of Aspiration Thrombectomy Referenced studies that support recommendation are summarized in the Evidence Table .

Use of Intracoronary Imaging Synopsis Intracoronary imaging serves as a valuable tool for guiding the placement of coronary stents, particularly in cases involving the left main artery or complex lesions, resulting in greater stent expansion, less stent malap- position, and fewer coronary dissections. 1,2,4,13 IVUS provides a comprehensive view of the vessel wall, allowing for the evaluation of plaque burden, calci ﬁca- tion extent, lesion length, and external elastic lamina diameter before stent placement. It also facilitates the assessment of minimum stent area, malapposition, underexpansion, tissue protrusion, edge disease, and edge dissection after stent deployment. 14 OCT utilizes infrared light to produce high-resolution images of the vessel wall, offering speci ﬁca d v a n t a g e si na s s e s s i n g calcium thickness, lipid presence, thrombus formation, ﬁbroatheroma, and plaque rup ture, which is particularly helpful in patients with ACS. It is also useful for examining stent strut neointimal thickness, apposition, and edge dissections. However, it has limitations regarding imaging depth and requires the injection of contrast to clear blood, limiting its utility in cases of ostial left main disease. Both IVUS and OCT play essential roles in evaluating the necessity for lesion preparation, choosing the appropriate stent size, reducing the likelihood of geographical errors, conﬁrming proper stent expansion, identifying compli- cations, and determining the underlying reasons for stent failure. 14,15 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Randomized trials including patients with ACS have shown that intracoronary imaging guidance is associ- ated with lower risk of target vessel failure (cardiac death, target vessel MI, or ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization) in patients undergoing PCI. 1-4 The advantages of intracoronary imaging are sustained over time and can be extended to less complex lesions.5 Renovate-Complex PCI (Randomized Controlled Trial of Intravascular Imaging Guidance versus Angiography- Guidance on Clinical Outcomes after Complex Percu- taneous Coronary Intervention) demonstrated a sig- niﬁcant reduction in target vessel failure with intracoronary guidance (IVUS or OCT) versus angio- graphic guidance after a median follow-up of 2.1 years. 1 The OCTOBER (Optical Coherence Tomography Opti- mized Bifurcation Event Reduction) trial showed a signi ﬁcant reduction in target vessel failure at 2 years with OCT versus angiographic guidance in bifurcation lesions, including left main bifurcations. 4 Randomized trials directly comparing OCT versus IVUS have demonstrated that OCT is noninferior to IVUS for PCI- guidance. 6-8,10 However, the ILUMIEN IV: Optimal PCI (OCT Guided Coronary Stent Implantation Compared with Angiography) trial, the largest trial testing the strategy of imaging guidance with OCT, did not reveal a difference in target vessel failure with OCT in high-risk patients or patients with hi gh-risk lesions; however, the coprimary endpoint of minimal stent area was signi ﬁcantly larger with OCT guidance compared with angiography guidance. 2 The rates of deﬁnite or prob- able stent thrombosis were also signiﬁcantly lower with OCT-guided PCI compared with angiography-guided PCI. A minimum stent area of<4.5 to 5.0 mm2 by OCT is considered to be an independent predictor of MACE. 16,17 Two large network meta-analyses showed that, in aggregate, intracoronary imaging guidance ( w i t he i t h e rI V U So rO C T )f o rP C Id e c r e a s e sc a r d i a c death, target vessel MI, target lesion revascularization, and stent thrombosis. 11,18 Recommendation for Use of Intracoronary Imaging Referenced studies that support recommendation are summarized in the Evidence Table .

Recent studies suggest a lower risk of MACE (predominantly driven by a lower rate of recurrent ischemia and recurrent MI) when multivessel stenting occurs as a single procedure as opposed to when staged. 10-12 The decision to proceed with multivessel stenting and the timing of the pro- cedure should take into account the patient ’s clinical a n dh e m o d y n a m i cs t a t u s ,t h ed u r a t i o na n dc o m p l e x i t y of the infarct-related artery PCI, the complexity of dis- ease in the noninfarct-related artery, the amount of myocardium in jeopardy, and the presence of comor- bidities that might favor a conservative approach to care. Few studies of multivessel PCI have directly compared the ef ﬁcacy of a physiologic-guided PCI versus an angiographic-guided PCI approach. 17,18 A meta-analysis across trials did not suggest any differ- ential bene ﬁt for complete revascularization based on whether the approach was guided by fractional ﬂow reserve (FFR) or angiography alone. 3 Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. Over the past decade, numerous trials have reported a signi ﬁcant reduction in MACE with complete revas- cularization. 1,2,4-8 These studies have demonstrated beneﬁts to complete revascularization either at the time of PPCI 2,5-8 or as a staged procedure. 1,2,4,6 The PRAMI (Preventive Angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial, 8 one of the earliest trials of multi- vessel PCI, randomized 465 patients with STEMI and MVD to a strategy of complete revascularization versus culprit artery only rev ascularization. The trial was stopped early due to a signiﬁc a n tr e d u c t i o ni nt h e primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or refractory angina) with complete revascularization, with signi ﬁcant reductions in nonfatal MI and refractory angina and a trend in reduction in the rates of cardiovascular death. The COMPLETE (Complete versus Culprit-Only Revascu- larization Strategies to Trea t Multivessel Disease after Early PCI for STEMI) trial 1 randomized 4,041 patients with STEMI and signi ﬁcant MVD to a strategy of Recommendations for Management of Multivessel CAD in STEMI Referenced studies that support recommendations are summarized in the Evidence Table . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS 1A 1. In selected, hemodynamically stable patients with STEMI and multivessel disease (MVD), after successful PCI of the infarct- related artery, PCI of signiﬁcantly stenosed * noninfarct-related ar- teries is recommended to reduce the risk of death or MI and improve angina-related quality of life (QOL).† 1-9 2a C-EO 2.

In selected hemodynamically stable patients with STEMI and low-complexity MVD (those not intended for CABG surgery), multivessel PCI of signiﬁcantly stenosed noninfarct-related ar- teries at the time of PPCI may be preferred over a staged approach to reduce the risk of cardiovas- cular events. 10-12 3: Harm B-R 4. In patients with STEMI compli- cated by cardiogenic shock, routine PCI of a noninfarct- related artery at the time of PPCI should not be performed because of the higher risk of death or renal failure.* 13-15 *Signiﬁcantly stenosed refers to lesions that are severely diseased as deﬁned by the “2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization” as a visually estimated diameter stenosis severity of$70% for non–left main disease and$50% for left main disease.16 †Modiﬁed from the “2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization.”16 JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 Rao et al JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline 2183 staged PCI of the non –infarct-related artery (per- formed up to 45 days post MI) or culprit vessel–only revascularization with PCI reserved for patients with refractory symptoms. At a median follow-up of 3 years, multivessel PCI reduced cardiovascular death or MI and cardiovascular death, MI, or ischemia- driven revascularization. This bene ﬁtw a sc o n s i s t e n t across all subgroups. Angina-related QOL was also signi ﬁcantly improved with multivessel PCI, with a greater proportion of patients in the complete revascularization arm who were angina-free in long- term follow-up. 9 In a meta-analysis, complete revas- cularization reduced cardi ovascular death in patients with STEMI. 19 The bene ﬁts of complete revasculari- zation with multivessel PCI should not be extrapo- lated to patients with disease more suited to CABG surgery, because they were excluded from these trials. 2. The trials examining the beneﬁto fm u l t i v e s s e lP C Ii n patients with STEMI and MVD excluded patients intended for CABG surgery. Furthermore, few pa- tients with complex disease, such as chronic total occlusions or involvement of the left main artery, were included in these trials. For this reason, the beneﬁts of a strategy of multivessel PCI cannot be extrapolated to patients with more complex non- infarct-related artery disease. In patients with CCD and complex CAD, including complex left main dis- ease, or in patients with diabetes who have MVD involving the left anterior descending artery, CABG surgery is associated with improved event-free sur- v i v a lw h e nc o m p a r e dw i t hP C I . 20-24 As such, a similar beneﬁto fC A B Go v e rP C Im i g h tb ee x p e c t e df o rp a - tients with STEMI and complex non –infarct-related artery disease involving the left main or left anterior descending artery or in patients with diabetes and MVD involving the left anterior descending artery, who are stable and remote from their acute infarct, although the optimal timing of CABG is unclear in this setting and needs to take into account increased bleeding risk from DAPT. 3. Performing multivessel PCI at the time of PPCI offers the convenience of a single procedure, allowing for faster recovery, without the risk of repeated arterial access, or the potential for recurrent ischemia before the staged PCI. The BIOVASC (Direct Complete Versus Staged Complete Revascularization in Patients Pre- senting With Acute Coronary Syndromes and Multi- vessel Disease) trial 10 randomized 1,525 patients with ACS (w40% with STEMI) and MVD to a strategy of a single setting immediate multivessel PCI or staged m u l t i v e s s e lP C I .A t1y e a r ,i m m e d i a t em u l t i v e s s e lP C I was noninferior to staged multivessel PCI for the primary endpoint all-cause death, MI, unplanned ischemia-driven revasculari zation, or cerebrovascular e v e n t s .W h e nc o m p a r e dw i t hs t a g e dP C I ,as i n g l e procedure multivessel PCI was associated with lower rates of recurrent MI and lower rates of unplanned ischemia-driven revascularization. The MULTISTARS AMI (Multivessel Immediat e Versus Staged Revascu- larization in Acute Myocardial Infarction) study 11 compared a strategy of a single procedure multi- v e s s e lP C Iw i t hs t a g e dm u l t i v e s s e lP C Ii n8 4 0p a - tients with STEMI and MVD. Immediate multivessel PCI was noninferior and superior to staged multi- vessel PCI for the primary endpoint of death, rein- f a r c t i o n ,s t r o k e ,u n p l a n n e di s c h e m i a - d r i v e n revascularization, or hospitalization for HF at 1 year. This was largely driven by a lower rate of recurrent ischemia and recurrent in farction in the immediate group. In a network meta-analysis comparing all strategies for managing the non –infarct-related ar- tery, a single procedure approach for immediate multivessel PCI was preferred followed by staged multivessel PCI. 12 Patients ideally suited for imme- d i a t ec o m p l e t er e v a s c u l a r i z a t i o ni n c l u d et h o s ew i t h uncomplicated PCI of the infarct-related artery and low complexity noninfarct-related artery disease with stable hemodynamics, normal LV ﬁlling pressures, and normal renal function. 4. In patients with STEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock and MVD, a strategy of multivessel PCI is associated with worse outcomes. 13-15 The CULPRIT- SHOCK (Culprit Lesion Only PCI versus Multivessel PCI in Cardiogenic Shock) trial 13 randomized 706 pa- tients with AMI, approximately 60% with STEMI, and cardiogenic shock to a strategy of complete multi- vessel PCI or culprit vessel –only PCI. At 30 days and 1 year, the rates of death or need for renal replace- ment therapy were signi ﬁcantly higher in the group of patients randomized to multivessel PCI. 13,14 Importantly, the CULPRIT-SHOCK trial only permitted enrollment if there was an identi ﬁable culprit lesion. In situations where an unstable- appearing nonculprit artery lesion was observed, or in those patients with an uncertain culprit lesion, the decision to proceed with multivessel PCI may be more nuanced.

Management of Multivessel CAD in NSTE-ACS Synopsis Multivessel coronary disease, de ﬁned as angiograph- ically signiﬁcant stenosis ($50%) in$2 epicardial arteries, is present in up to 40% to 70% of patients with NSTE-ACS. Identi ﬁcation of the culprit artery in these situations might be challenging. 13 Several subsets of patients, including those with complex left main disease, complex 3-vessel disease, and diabetes with left anterior descending artery involvement, might be appropriate for CABG surgery. 12 A Heart Team approach is recommended to consider CABG surgery versus multivessel PCI based on the complexity of CAD, technical feasibility, patient ’s surgical risk, and the potential for rehabilitation after CABG surgery. Dedicated RCTs comparing multivessel PCI versus culprit-only PCI exclusively among hemodynami- cally stable patients with NSTE-ACS are lacking. A large subgroup analysis from an RCT that included both pa- tients with STEMI and NSTE-ACS and several observa- tional studies have suggested that multivessel PCI among selected patients not intended for CABG reduces risk of MACE. 1-4,6,14 Angiographic assessment might over- estimate the severity of a nonculprit lesion. 15 In one study, routine integration of physiological assessment of a nonculprit artery stenosis in NSTE-ACS led to change in management (ie, from revascularization to medical treatment only) in 38% of the cases.16 Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. Studies evaluating the bene ﬁt of multivessel PCI among patients with NSTE-ACS and MVD excluded patients planned for CABG. The potential bene ﬁto f multivessel PCI cannot be extrapolated to patients with complex CAD. Indeed, certain subsets of patients might derive a survival beneﬁt from CABG, including those with diabetes and disease involving the left anterior descending artery, left main with high complexity, MVD with complex or diffuse CAD, and those with severe LV dysfunction ( Table 16 ). 17-20 Accordingly, a Heart Team approach is recommended to consider CABG surgery versus multivessel PCI based on the complexity of the CAD, technical feasibility, patient ’s surgical risk, and the potential for rehabili- tation after CABG surgery in these situations. In pa- tients who are deemed appropriate for CABG, surgery could be considered prior to hospital discharge. Several observational studies have suggested that early CABG (performed within 3 days of presentation) may be associated with similar outcomes compared with delayed CABG. 21-23 2. The FIRE (Functional Assessment in Elderly MI Pa- tients With Multivessel Dis ease) trial enrolled 1,445 elderly patients (median age, 80 years) with multi- vessel disease (ie, nonculprit artery with minimum vessel diameter >2.5 mm and angiography estimated stenosis 50% to 99%) and ACS (w65% with NSTE-ACS). Multivessel PCI reduced the risk of MACE, as well as reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The beneﬁt was consistent between patients with NSTE- A C Sv e r s u sp a t i e n t sw i t hS T E M I . 1 Several observa- tional studies and a meta-analysis of observational studies demonstrated that multivessel PCI is associ- ated with a lower incidence of long-term MACE. 2,3,6 Few RCTs have evaluated the optimal timing of a Recommendations for Management of Multivessel CAD in NSTE-ACS Referenced studies that support recommendations are summarized in the Evidence Table .

In stable patients with NSTE-ACS with MVD but without left main stenosis who are not intended for CABG surgery and undergoing culprit-lesion PCI, PCI of signiﬁ- cant nonculprit lesions (at the time of the index procedure or as a staged procedure) is recom- mended to reduce the risk of MACE. 1-6 2b B-R 3.

The SMILE (Single Staged Versus Multistaged PCI in Multivessel NSTEMI Pa- tients) trial enrolled 584 patients and demonstrated that multivessel PCI conducted in a single procedure reduces risk of MACE at 1 year driven by a lower risk of revascularization. 4 The BIOVASC trial randomized 1,525 patients with ACS ( w60% with NSTE-ACS) and showed that multivessel PCI in a single procedure was noninferior to staged PCI with respect to MACE at 1 year and without evidence of an interaction between patients with NSTE-ACS versus patients with STEMI. 5,24 3. In a secondary analysis including 328 patients with NSTE-ACS and MVD from the FAME (Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiography for Multivessel Evalua- tion) trial that randomized patients to either angiography-guided PC I (if diameter stenosis$50%) or FFR-guided PCI (if FFR #0.80), FFR-guided PCI reduced the number of stents and the incidence of MACE at 2 years. 7 The FRAME-AMI (Fractional Flow Reserve vs. Angiography-Gu ided Strategy for Manage- ment of Non-Infarction Related Artery Stenosis in Pa- tients with Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial enrolled 562 patients with ACS and MVD (w53% with NSTE-ACS) and were randomized to FFR-guided PCI (if FFR#0.80) or angiography-guided PCI (diameter stenosis of >50%). FFR-guided PCI reduced the number of stents and the risk of MACE at 3.5 years with no evidence of interaction between patients with NSTE-ACS and pa- tients with STEMI. Of note, the trial was prematurely terminated due to slow recruitment and enrolled<50% of the planned 1,292 patients. 9 In the FAMOUS-NSTEMI (Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiographically Guided Management to Optimise Outcomes in Unsta- ble Coronary Syndromes) trial, which randomized 350 patients with NSTE-ACS and MVD to FFR-guided PCI (if FFR #0.80) or angiography-guided PCI (diam- eter stenosis of >30%), FFR-guided PCI reduced the number of revascularization procedures at 1 year. 8 4. In patients with NSTE-ACS complicated by cardiogenic shock and MVD, multivessel PCI at the time of the in- dex procedure is associated with worse outcomes. 10,11 The CULPRIT-SHOCK (Culprit Lesion Only PCI versus Multivessel PCI in Cardiogenic Shock) trial randomized 706 patients with AMI and cardiogenic shock (approx- imately 40% with NSTE-ACS) to multivessel PCI at the time of the index procedure or culprit-only PCI. Mul- tivessel PCI was associated with higher rates of death or need for renal replacement therapy at 30 days and at 1y e a r . 10,11 Notably, the CULPRIT SHOCK trial enrolled only patients with an identiﬁable culprit lesion. When there is an unstable-appearing nonculprit, or uncertain culprit, artery lesion, the decision to proceed with multivessel PCI will be based on the anatomic and clinical circumstances. 8.

Revascularization in ACS With Cardiogenic Shock TABLE 16 Considerations for Choice of Coronary Revascularization Strategy for Patients With NSTE-ACS and MVD In patients with NSTE-ACS and MVD, CABG surgery may be preferred over multivessel PCI in any of the following situations: Signi ﬁcant left main coronary stenosis with high-complexity CAD Multivessel CAD with complex or diffuse CAD Diabetes mellitus and MVD with the involvement of the LAD Multivessel CAD or complex left main CAD with severe left ventricular dysfunction Adapted from the“2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Coronary Revascularization Guideline.”12 CAD indicates coronary artery disease; CABG, coronary artery bypass grafting; LAD, left anterior descending artery; MVD, multivessel disease; NSTE-ACS, non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes; and PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.

In the SHOCK (Should We E mergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for C ardiogenic Shock) trial, 2 re- ported in 1999, patients with AMI and cardiogenic shock were randomized to medical therapy or emergency revascularization. Among the patients randomized to revascularization, 64% of patients were referred for PCI and 36% for CABG. The median time from randomiza- tion to revascularization was 0.9 hours for PCI and 2.7 hours for CABG. Despite lack of a signiﬁcant difference in the primary endpoint of mortality at 30 days, emer- gency revascularization with either PCI or CABG reduced the mortality rate at 6 months, 2 and the mor- tality beneﬁt was maintained through 1 and 6 years.10,11 In an observational analysis from the FITT-STEMI (Feedback Intervention and Treatment Times in ST- Elevation Myocardial Infarction) trial, for every 10- minute delay in PPCI after 60 minutes from FMC, there were an additional 3 to 4 deaths per 100 with a>80% mortality rate beyond 6 hours of delay from FMC. 1 Therefore, it is recommended that PPCI should be per- formed in patients with STEMIa n dc a r d i o g e n i cs h o c ka s soon as possible, ideally within 90 minutes, to reduce the mortality rate. 1,2 Observational studies suggest that emergency CABG remains a treatment option in patients with cardiogenic shock who are not amenable to primary reperfusion with PCI3,4 or when PCI is unsuccessful.4,12 2. In patients with STEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock and MVD, a strategy of multivessel PCI is asso- ciated with worse outcomes. 5-7 The CULPRIT-SHOCK trial 5 randomized 706 patients with AMI (approxi- mately 60% with STEMI) and cardiogenic shock to a strategy of complete multive ssel PCI or culprit-only PCI. At 30 days and 1 year, the rates of death or need for renal replacement therapy were signiﬁcantly higher in the group of patients randomized to multivessel PCI. 5,6 Importantly, the CULPRIT SHOCK trial permitted enrollment only if there was an identi ﬁable culprit lesion. In situations where there is an unstable appearing nonculprit artery lesion, or in those patients with an uncertain culprit, the decision to proceed with multivessel PCI may be more nuanced. 8.2. MCS in Patients With ACS and Cardiogenic Shock Synopsis Cardiogenic shock is estimated to occur in approxi- m a t e l y1 0 %o fp a t i e n t sw i t hS T E M Ia n di sa s s o c i a t e dw i t h an early mortality rate of 40% to 50%. 10,11 Several types of devices for temporary MCS a re available and have been studied in patients with cardiogenic shock with variable efﬁcacy and increased risk of vascular complications. IABP counterpulsation improves coronary perfusion and reduces cardiac afterload. It is relatively easy to use and has a smaller insertion pro ﬁle, which is associated with lower rates of vascular access site complications when compared with other MCS devices. 12,13 Percutaneous microaxial ﬂow pumps unload the LV by draining blood from the LV and pumping it to the ascending aorta. They are dependent on adequate right ventricular function to ﬁl lt h eL Va n dr e q u i r ea d e q u a t eo x y g e n a t i o no fb l o o d .V A - ECMO provides both blood ﬂow and oxygenation but in- creases afterload. Randomized trials of MCS devices remain challenging to conduct due to relative lack of equipoise on the part of treating physicians, leading to selective patient enrollment and limiting the generaliz- ability of study results.

The DanGer-SHOCK (Danish-German Cardiogenic Shock) trial enrolled patients with STEMI and cardio- genic shock of <24 hours duration, de ﬁned as hypo- tension (SBP <100 mm Hg or vasopressor support), end- organ hypoperfusion (arterial lactate $2.5 mmol/L and/ or SvO 2 <55% with a normal PaO2), and LVEF <45%. P a t i e n t sw h ow e r ec o m a t o s e( G l a s g o wC o m aS c a l e score <8) after out-of-hospit al cardiac arrest and pa- tients with overt right ventricular failure were excluded. 1 The study enrolled 360 patients at 14 s p e c i a l i z e dc e n t e r si nE u r o p ea n dr a n d o m i z e dt h e mt o use of a microaxialﬂow pump or standard of care. Use of a microaxial ﬂow pump signiﬁcantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality at 180 days by 26% (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.55-0.99]; P ¼ 0.04; absolute risk reduction, 12.7%; number needed to treat¼ 8 )c o m p a r e dw i t hs t a n d a r do f care. The absolute risk reduction seen in this trial is similar to the absolute risk reduction in 6-month mor- tality observed with emerge ncy revascularization in patients with AMI and LV failure in the SHOCK (Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock) trial. 1,20 However, given the increased risks of serious complications like bleeding, limb ischemia, and renal replacement therapy with the microaxial ﬂow pump seen in the DanGer Shock trial, the COR is based on the balance between these risks and the reduction in death. Additionally, the timing of micro- axial ﬂow pump placement was not dictated by the trial protocol; thus, the preferred timing of placement is unclear. Based on these results, use of a microaxialﬂow pump is reasonable to reduce mortality in patients with STEMI and cardiogenic shock who have clinical features consistent with the inclusion criteria of the DanGer- SHOCK trial. In particular, patients with STEMI who present with SCAI shock stages C, D, or E, who are non- comatose and have adequate peripheral vasculature to accommodate large-bore access are reasonable candi- dates for the microaxialﬂow pump. 2. Although randomized trial data are lacking, MCS de- vices can be considered as a bridge to surgery for pa- tients with mechanical complications of AMI when adequate clinical stabilization is required and may allow for further tissue stabilization at the injured site. A systemic review of patients treated with MCS as a bridge to surgical treatment of ventricular septal rupture yiel- ded 111 studies (n ¼ 2,440) with almost all patients receiving initial IABP support (n ¼ 2,263). 2 Of the 129 patients who underwent additional MCS device place- ment (77.5% of whom were on VA-ECMO), the lowest in- hospital mortality was observed in those treated with VA-ECMO (29.2%) when compared with those treated with an IABP alone (52.0%). However, 2 database ana- lyses that were not included in the systematic review demonstrated higher in-hospital death with use of VA- ECMO in patients with post-AMI mechanical complica- tions. 3,4 Evaluation of the ECLS (Extracorporeal Life Support) Organizations Regi stry yielded 158 patients with post-AMI mechanical complications who under- went VA-ECMO. 3 Survival to hospital discharge here was low at 37.3%, and complications related to VA- ECMO use occurred in 75.3% of patients. Evaluation of the National Inpatient Sample yielded 10,726 patients with post-STEMI mechanical complications, and the use of VA-ECMO was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (OR, 2.80 [95% CI, 1.92-4.04]), while the use of an IABP was not associated with lower mortality. 4 Both data sources included use of VA-ECMO at any time during the hospitalization for post-AMI mechani- cal complications, including use of VA-ECMO post- surgery, a cohort at highest risk of in-hospital mortality. 3. The IABP-SHOCK II (Intraaortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock II) trial randomized patients with AMI and severe or refractorycardiogenic shock in whom early revascularization was planned to IABP or no IABP. 5 At 30 days and long-term follow-up, no differences were observed in the primary outcome of all-cause death or the secondary biomarker or measures of disease severity endpoints. 6,7 VA-ECMO has not been shown to reduce death compared with medical therapy alone in patients with cardiogenic shock in the setting of MI but increases major bleeding and vascular complications. 21 The ECMO-CS (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in the Therapy of Cardiogenic Shock) trial randomized patients with rapidly deteriorating or severe cardiogenic shock to immediate or no immediate VA-ECMO. 8 At 30 days, no differences were observed in the primary composite endpoint of all-ca use death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and implementation of another MCS de- vice with results consistent in the 74 patients with cardiogenic shock related to MI and in the as-treated analysis. The ECLS-SHOCK (Extracorporeal Life Support in Infarct-Related Cardiogenic Shock) trial randomized patients with AMI and severe or refractory cardiogenic shock in whom early revascularization was planned to early ECLS or no ECLS. 9 No differences were observed in the primary outcome of the 30-day mortality rate or secondary outco mes.

Overall, these studies do not support routine use of IABP and VA-ECMO in patients with AMI and cardiogenic shock. 9. ACS COMPLICATIONS 9.1. Mechanical Complications Synopsis Timely reperfusion therapy has reduced the incidence of mechanical complications (ventricular septal rupture, mitral valve insufﬁciency due to papillary muscle infarc- tion or rupture, or free wall rupture) after AMI (Figure 9 ). 3,4 Although occasionally found incidentally, mechanical complications commonly present with recur- rent or refractory chest pain or a new murmur accompa- nied by disproportionate HF, cardiogenic shock, or sudden cardiac death on clinical presentation within the ﬁrst week after an AMI. Medical therapy alone is associ- ated with high risk of early death 5,6;d eﬁnitive surgical correction is frequently the treatment of choice. 7,8 Mor- tality rates with surgery are highest in subjects with cardiogenic shock and in those requiring early emer- gency/urgent intervention after AMI. 9,10 Observed mor- tality rates following delayed surgery (>7 days) are lower but patient selection and survivor bias contribute to this observation. 11,12 The availability of temporary MCS de- vices has led to increasing trends for delayed surgery due to concerns for the initial degree of extensive tissue destruction. 13,14 Delayed surgical intervention may enable hemodynamic stabilization, l ead to recovery of end-organ injury, and promote infarct tissue healing and maturation that could facilitate de ﬁnitive repair. Percutaneous ap- proaches toward repair have been used in patients with prohibitive surgical risk or contraindications to surgery as a primary or temporizing opti on in the setting of acute mitral regurgitation and ventricular septal rupture and remain an evolving area of investigation. 15,16 Select pa- tients with mechanical complications of ACS may be considered for cardiac transplantation or durable left ventricular assist device as a primary or bailout treatment strategy to improve survival. 17 Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. No RCTs evaluate the role of transfer of patients with mechanical complications after MI to dedicated centers with cardiac surgical expertise. Although overall surgi- cal mortality is approximately 40%, it remains the treatment strategy of choice. Hemodynamic deteriora- tion is unpredictable and can be precipitous in previ- ously stable subjects. Consequently, transfer to a Level 1 cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) 18 with access to various temporary MCS devices and multidisciplinary experienced teams of surgical, interventional, HF, and palliative care specialists is recommended. Emerging data following the creation of shock teams supports the transfer of hemodynamically unstable patients from community hospitals to centers with multidisciplinary expertise. 19,20 Although the exact timing remains un- certain, early corrective surgery is the treatment of choice for mechanical complications of MI. 7,8,12 The risk of surgical correction is highest when performed in the setting of cardiogenic shock 9,21,22 and appears lower when surgery is delayed. The early hazard with surgery is attributed to patient acuity, end-organ injury, and lack of tissue integrity to promote deﬁnitive and lasting repair. Selected subjects may be candidates for either deﬁnitive or temporizing percutaneous structural intervention as a bridge to deﬁnitive surgical interven- tion. 15,16,23 Given the complexity of decision making, a Heart Team approach to guide feasibility, timing, and nature of corrective intervention as well as the need and selection of MCS support is recommended as soon as a mechanical complication is diagnosed. 2. No RCTs have evaluated the role of MCS in improving clinical outcomes in the setting of mechanical compli- c a t i o n s .T h ec h o i c eo fs p e c iﬁc MCS should be individ- ualized and guided by patient characteristics, nature of the mechanical complication, and the hemodynamic proﬁle. In patients with ventricular septal rupture, the use of an IABP has been shown to reduce left-to-right shunting and improve hemodynamics in patients with and without shock. 24 Favorable hemodynamic effects with IABP are also noted with acute ischemic mitral regurgitation. Various devices have been utilized when IABP fails or if hemodynamic instability remains pro- found. 1 The use of MCS devices has enhanced hemo- dynamic stabilization to allow the opportunity for consideration of delayed corrective strategy. 13,14 Recommendations for Mec hanical Complications Referenced studies that support recommendations are summarized in the Evidence Table .

Many of these considerations have been addressed in depth in separate guideline documents. 10 Generally, arrhythmic complications increase both morbidity and mortality rates in patients after ACS. Pa- tients who present with AMI with reduced LVEF (#40%) have increased risk of new-onset AF, bradyarrhythmias, and ventricular arrhythmias. 11,12 This risk appears to be increased in those patients who are not revascularized or receive ﬁbrinolytic therapy compared with those who undergo PCI.11 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Ventricular arrhythmia sa r ec o m m o na f t e rA C Sa n d more common in patients with reduced LVEF. MADIT II (Multicenter Automatic De ﬁbrillator Implantation Trial) demonstrated a 31% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.51-0.93]) for prophy- lactic implantation of a cardiac deﬁbrillator in patients with an LVEF#30% who were at least 30 days after MI or 3 months after revascularization for MI and had an anticipated life expectancy longer than 1 year. 2 A mortality beneﬁt for prophylactic ICD implantation has also been shown in patients with an LVEF #35% and New York Heart Association class II or III HF symp- toms, 1,3 as well as in patients with inducible ventricu- lar tachycardia or ventricular ﬁbrillation and an LVEF #40%1,4,13 (Table 17). 2. The risk of ventricular arrythmias and sudden cardiac d e a t hi sh i g h e s te a r l ya f t e rM I ,a l t h o u g ht h er o u t i n e implantation of a deﬁbrillator (for primary prevention) in patients with LV dysfunction early after MI or CABG has not been associated with improved survival. 14-16 In DINAMIT (Deﬁbrillator in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial), ICD implantation led to a 58% reduction in arrhythmic deaths within 6 to 40 days post MI with ejection fraction #35%; however, this was offset by an increase in nonarrhythmic deaths. 16 Sustained epi- sodes of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular ﬁbrilla- tion occurring >48 hours after reperfusion are associated with an increased risk of death,12,17 and the risk of sudden cardiac death is highest in the ﬁrst month. 5 Patients with ventricular arrhythmias should ﬁrst be managed with beta blockers and/or antiar- rhythmic therapy. The bene ﬁt of ICD implantation in patients with persistent or sustained ventricular ar- rhythmias and who are <40 days post MI remains un- clear. 15,16,18 A single-center observational study enrolled patients post STEMI (median, 9 days) and referred those with an LVEF #40% for electrophysio- l o g i ct e s t i n ga n di m p l a n t e da nI C Do n l yi nt h o s ew i t h inducible ventricular tachycardia. Although a ran- domized comparator arm was unavailable, 22% of those who underwent ICD implantation had ventricu- lar tachycardia terminated by the device during the ﬁrst 12 months. 6 The effects of ICD implantation on mortality cannot be de ﬁnitely ascertained, and more research is required. Radiofrequency catheter ablation should be considered in patients with recurrent ven- tricular tachycardia or ventricular ﬁbrillation followed by ICD implantation. 19 Earlier ICD implantation can be considered in patients who have an indication for a permanent pacemaker prior to hospital discharge and in whom LVEF is not expected to recover, but no evi- dence was observed to de ﬁnitively demonstrate the safety of this approach. 10,20 3. In the VEST (Vest Prevention of Early Sudden Death) t r i a l ,t h er o u t i n eu s eo fat e m p o r a r yw e a r a b l e cardioverter-de ﬁbrillator did not signi ﬁcantly reduce the primary endpoint (composite of sudden death or death from ventricular tachyarrhythmias at 90 days) in patients with AMI and LVEF #35% (relative risk, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.37-1.21]). 7,21 The secondary endpoint of death from any cause was lower in the wearable vest group compared with the no-device group (relative risk, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.43-0.98]); only 12 of 48 patients were wearing the device at the time of death. 7 Greater beneﬁt was demonstrated in those who were compliant with the device. 21 As such, use of a wearable cardioverter-de ﬁbrillator could be considered in high- risk patients with reduced LVEF as a bridge to consideration for the need for an ICD. 4. Patients with STEMI with second- or third-degree atrioventricular block have higher in-hospital mortal- ity than those without high-degree atrioventricular block. 22,23 Patients who present with ACS with com- p l e t eh e a r tb l o c kh a v eah i g h e ri n c i d e n c eo fc a r d i o - genic shock, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. 24,25 In a contemporary cohort of patients with AMI, the TABLE 17 LVEF and Patient Characteristics De ﬁning an Indication for Prophylactic ICD Implantation for Primary Prevention in Ischemic Heart Disease LVEF Patient Category: All Patients Should Have Expected Survival of $1y #30% NYHA class I, II, or III 2 31%-35% NYHA class II or III 1,3 #40% Inducible VT 1,4,13 ICD indicates implantable cardioverter-de ﬁbrillator; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; NYHA, New York Heart Association; and VT, ventricular tachycardia.

High-degree atrioventricular block is not considered to be responsible for the increased mortality but is a surrogate marker of larger infarct size. 28 Temporary pacemaker insertion in the setting of ACS in patients with high-degree atrioven- tricular block and other pacer indications has been found to improve postdischarge survival. 8,9,29 Perma- nent pacemaker insertion is recommended with unre- solved high-degree atrioventricular block that persists >72 hours. 20 9.3. Pericarditis Management After MI Synopsis The diagnostic criteria for post-MI pericarditis are dis- played in Table 18. Pericarditis that occurs early after MI typically arises 1 to 3 days after a transmural event and is presumed to be inﬂammatory in nature due to adjacent myocardial necrosis. These cases of early pericarditis are typically transient, lasting several days, and will resolve with conservative therapy. Acetaminophen can be given for symptomatic relief. A second form of pericarditis may occur weeks after MI (Dressler ’ss y n d r o m e )a n di s believed to be immune-mediated as a response to peri- cardial irritation or damage, such as in the setting of any degree of hemopericardium. 1,2 These cases of late peri- carditis often require additional therapy (Table 19). Given the rarity of post-MI pericarditis (0.1%-0.5%) in the era of early coronary reperfusion therapy, 3 dedicated RCTs of h i g h - d o s ea s p i r i na r el a c k i n g ,a n dd a t aa r ee x t r a p o l a t e d from studies of the heterogeneous diagnosis of acute pericarditis. 4 Furthermore, RCTs of colchicine were per- formed on a background of high-dose aspirin therapy.5-7 If symptoms persist despite standard supportive therapy in early pericarditis and in any l ate pericarditis, high-dose aspirin may be used to reduce symptoms. 4 The use of colchicine should also be considered to reduce symptoms and decrease risk of recurrence 8,9; suggested dosing is summarized in Table 19. The value of a loading dose of colchicine in this setting is unclear. Routine use of high- dose aspirin or colchicine is not indicated for the man- agement of asymptomatic pericardial effusions. 10,11 Glu- cocorticoids and nonsteroidal anti-in ﬂammatory drugs (other than aspirin) are potentially harmful due to possible increase in risk of recurrent MI or impaired myocardial healing and risk of rupture. 12,13 9.4. Management of LV Thrombus After MI Synopsis LV thrombus typically occurs in the setting of large anterior STEMI and can lead to thromboembolic compli- cations, including stroke and systemic embolization. In the era of PCI, the incidence of LV thrombus after ACS has decreased and is estimated to be<5% to 10% in the post- MI population. 1-3 Limited RCT data are available on the contemporary management of LV thrombus, and current management is based mostly on retrospective and observational data and expert consensus. Patients at highest risk for LV thrombus include those with anterior STEMI involving the left anterior descending artery, LVEF <30% (especially in the presence of an LV aneu- rysm), and longer times to reperfusion. An echocardio- gram is the recommended imaging modality for diagnosis, given its wide accessibility and low cost. 4 Cardiac MRI is more sensitive for detection of LV thrombus and may be considered when there is high clinical suspicion and echocardiogram results are inconclusive. LV thrombus may form later during hospitalization or after discharge; therefore, repeat imaging can sometimes detect LV thrombus in high-risk patients. 5 Because DAPT is recom- mended for most patients early after ACS, the addition of an anticoagulant for LV thrombus needs to be considered in the context of the patient’s overall bleeding risk versus their risk of an embolic event. Most patients with LV thrombus will warrant anticoagulation for a period of 3 months, at which time the presence of residual thrombus can be assessed by repeat imaging to help determine whether a more prolonged course is warranted. 1 Although direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are routinely used in TABLE 18 Clinical Criteria for Diagnosis of Pericarditis Diagnosis Is Made With Presence of Pleuritic Chest Pain and‡1 of the Following Criteria: n Friction pericardial rub on auscultation n Electrocardiographic evidence such as classic PR-segment depression or diffusive concave ST-segment elevations, or in the setting of MI, persistent ST-segment elevations or dynamic T-wave changes n New or growing pericardial effusion on echocardiography MI indicates myocardial infarction. TABLE 19 Additional Therapy for Persistent/Late Pericarditis Symptoms Medical Therapy Dosing Schedule High-dose aspirin 500-1,000 mg every 6-8 h until symptoms improve Colchicine 0.5-0.6 mg once * or twice daily for 3 mo *Daily dosing should be used in patients who weigh<70 kg and further adjusted in patients with stage 4-5 kidney disease, severe hepatic impairment, or with concomitant P-glycoprotein and/or moderate and severe CYP3A4 inhibitors.

Observational studies and small RCTs have suggested that DOAC may be noninferior to vitamin K antagonist with respect to mortality, stroke, or LV thrombus resolution, and DOACs may offer an improved bleeding proﬁle. 6 The practical management of LV thrombi is more completely addressed in other documents. 1,6 10. IN-HOSPITAL ISSUES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ACS 10.1. Cardiac Intensive Care Unit Synopsis The nurse-to-patient ratio in the CICU should be sufﬁ- cient to provide (1) continuous electrocardiographic rhythm monitoring, (2) frequent assessment of vital signs and mental status, and (3) ab ility to perform rapid car- dioversion and de ﬁbrillation for arrhythmias. 1,2 Some hospitals may not have a dedicated CICU but rather care for patients with MI within a general multipurpose ICU; this approach requires trained providers with suf ﬁcient expertise in the care of cardiac patients. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Admission to the CICU and optimal length of stay in the CICU after an MI should be based on patients ’ risk proﬁles and clinical stability, while considering the patient ’s baseline cardiac risk and comorbidities. Pa- tients with ACS with continuing/ongoing angina, he- modynamic instability, uncontrolled arrhythmias, or a large MI with HF, cardiogenic shock, or both, should be admitted to a CICU. 1,2 Patients with ongoing ischemic symptoms should be preferent ially triaged for cardiac catheterization whenever possible. Stable patients with ACS and without recurrent ischemia, signi ﬁcant ar- rhythmias, pulmonary edema, or hemodynamic insta- bility do not need CICU admission and can be admitted to an intermediate care or telemetry unit. Clinical pre- dictors may be useful for helping identify patients who will require CICU care. For example, the ACTION ICU risk score for CICU admission integrates 9 variables on presentation to the ED including: signs or symptoms of H F ,i n i t i a lh e a r tr a t e ,i n i t i a lS B P ,i n i t i a lt r o p o n i n ,i n i t i a l serum creatinine, prior revascularization, chronic lung disease, ST-segment depression, and age >70 years. 3 10.2. Management of Anemia in ACS Synopsis Anemia is common in patients with ACS and is associ- ated with worse short- and long-term outcomes. 2-4 Ane- mia is associated with adverse outcomes irrespective of whether the anemia is chronic and due to comorbid con- ditions, or acute and the result of bleeding related to antithrombotic therapy and/o r invasive procedures. The adverse effects of anemia may be due to decreased myocardial oxygen delivery, increased myocardial oxy- gen demand due to increased cardiac output, or the avoidance of potentially bene ﬁcial antithrombotic drugs and/or procedures. In observational studies, blood transfusion has been associated with worse clinical out- comes. 5-8 Randomized trials in medically ill patients and those undergoing cardiac surgery have demonstrated s i m i l a ro rb e t t e ro u t c o m e sw i t har e s t r i c t i v et r a n s f u s i o n strategy (targeting a blood hemoglobin level around 8 g/dL) than with a liberal transfusion strategy (targeting a blood hemoglobin level around 10 g/dL). 9-11 However, randomized trial evidence for populations with ACS sug- gests possible clinical bene ﬁtf o ram o r el i b e r a l Recommendation for CICU COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 C-EO 1. Patients with ACS and with ongoing angina, hemodynamic instability, uncontrolled arrhyth- mias, suboptimal reperfusion, or cardiogenic shock should be admitted to a CICU to reduce cardiovascular events. Recommendation for Management of Anemia in ACS Referenced studies that support recommendation are summarized in the Evidence Table . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 2b B-R 1. In patients with ACS and acute or chronic anemia, blood trans- fusion to achieve a hemoglobin level ‡10 g/dL may be reasonable to reduce cardiovascular events. 1 JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 Rao et al JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline 2193 transfusion strategy targeting a hemoglobin level above 10 g/dL compared with targeting a hemoglobin level above 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL. 1,12,13 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. The MINT (Myocardial Ischemia and Transfusion) trial randomly assigned 3,504 patients with acute STEMI or NSTEMI and anemia with a blood hemoglobin level of <10 g/dL (13% with recent bleeding) to a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfusing if the hemoglobin level was <7-8 g/dL) or a liberal transfusion strategy (transfusing if the hemoglobin level was <10 g/dL). 1 Patients were ineligible for enrollment if they had un- controlled bleeding, were r eceiving palliative treat- ment, or were scheduled to have cardiac surgery. Transfusion could be delayed for patients with volume overload or until day of dialysis in patients with end- s t a g er e n a ld i s e a s e .T h ep r i m a r yo u t c o m eo f3 0 - d a y death or recurrent MI occurred in 16.9% of patients in the restrictive strategy and 14.5% of patients in the liberal strategy (relative risk, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.99-1.34]; P ¼ 0.07). Death occurred in 9.9% of patients in the restrictive strategy and 8.3% of patients in the liberal strategy (relative risk, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.94-1.49]), and cardiac death occurred in 5.5% of patients in the restrictive strategy and 3.2% of patients in the liberal strategy (relative risk, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.26-2.40]). Although the MINT trial did not demonstrate a statis- tically signiﬁcant reduction in its primary endpoint, the results suggest that a liberal blood transfusion strategy targeting a hemoglobin level around 10 g/dL may pro- vide short-term clinical bene ﬁt over a restrictive transfusion strategy targeting a hemoglobin level above 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL in patients with AMI and anemia. 10.3. Telemetry and Length of Stay Synopsis Advances in vascular access methods, coronary revas- cularization, and concomitant medical therapies have contributed to shortening length of stay and further facilitated changes in discharge patterns after PCI in the setting of ACS. There remainslimited evidence regarding the optimal length of stay after MI. Patients with STEMI represent a higher risk cohort who may require longer length of stay. Available data suggest that an early discharge strategy of <3 days from admission is not associated with increased mortality for low-risk patients after STEMI who have undergone PCI. 3-8 T h eZ w o l l es c o r e has been recommended as a clinical tool to help identify patients after PPCI in STEMI at low risk of death (low-risk patients, score #3) who can potentially be discharged earlier from the hospital (48 to 72 hours). Predictors of mortality in the Zwolle score include age, Killip class, postprocedural TIMI Flow Grade, 3-vessel disease, ante- rior infarction, and ischemic time. 3 Optimal length of stay in the setting of NSTE-ACS has been less rigorously studied. Small retrospective studies have suggested safety of very early or same-day discharge after PCI for patients with ACS, with most (71%) of same-day discharge being troponin-negative. 9 Patients being considered for early discharge should be clinically stable without evi- dence of ongoing ischemia, acute kidney injury, LV dysfunction, HF, and procedural complications and with adequate postdischarge support. 8 Hospitals and care providers should ensure that patients have access to postdischarge prescriptio n medications and adequate follow-up. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. The number of studies addressing telemetry duration are few and the focus has been on arrhythmia moni- toring, not continuous ST-segment monitoring. Continuous ST-segment monitoring can be considered for higher-risk patients, including those with suspected ischemia who are not yet revascularized. 1,10-14 Patients with ACS who are at low risk for cardiac arrhythmias require rhythm monitoring for #24 hours or until cor- onary revascularization (whichever comes ﬁrst) in a telemetry unit, while individuals at intermediate to high risk for cardiac arrh ythmia may require rhythm monitoring for >24 hours in a telemetry unit or in an intermediate care unit, depe nding on the clinical pre- sentation, degree of revascularization, and early Recommendation for Telemetry and Length of Stay COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 C-LD 1. In patients with ACS, telemetry monitoring is recommended to reduce cardiovascular events with duration determined by cardiac risk. 1,2 Rao et al JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2194 postrevascularization course with input from the treating cardiologist. 10,12-14 10.4. Noninvasive Diagnostic Testing Prior to Hospital Discharge Synopsis In patients with ACS, LV function should be routinely evaluated in patients prior to hospital discharge to help guide therapy and for risk stratiﬁcation. 1-3 Transthoracic echocardiography is generally the preferred modality because it is noninvasive and can provide a comprehen- sive assessment of ventricular and valvular function, as well as possibly detect LV thrombus or mechanical complications. Transthoracic echocardiography is there- fore strongly preferred for all patients hospitalized with STEMI because complications may be more likely to be present. In patients where transthoracic echocardiogra- phy is nondiagnostic, cardiac magnetic resonance imag- ing is a reasonable alternative in clinically stable patients. Alternatively, LV function and some mechanical compli- cations can be assessed invasively with left ventriculog- raphy in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, but other data regarding valvular function and wall motion are best evaluated with noninvasive methods like transthoracic echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. LV function may also be estimated noninvasively by myocardial perfusion imaging testing, but this will also provide incomplete information regarding the presence or absence of other complications of MI. For patients in whom LV function is found to be reduced, a repeat echocardiogram should be performed in 6 to 12 weeks to further guide treatment decisions and for consideration of need for an ICD. 4,5 Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. LV function should be routinely evaluated in patients with ACS prior to hospital discharge because LVEF guides therapeutic interventions and facilitates risk strati ﬁcation. The diagnosis of LV dysfunction is important because it may trigger consideration for the initiation or optimization of guideline-directed thera- peutic interventions for patients with HF or depressed LV function. It also helps identify patients with reduced LVEF who may require consideration for future primary prevention implantation of an ICD. Be- sides LVEF, transthoracic echocardiography facilitates the assessment of regional wall motion abnormalities, valvular function, mechanical complications, 4 and LV thrombus. 5 In cases in which LV function cannot be adequately assessed despite the use of contrast echo- cardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance is the preferred imaging modality for clinically stable pa- tients. 6-9 10.5. Discharge Planning 10.5.1. Patient Education Synopsis Patient education is universally valued and aims to deliver information from clinicians to patients to improve health behavior and long-term health-related outcomes. Clinicia n sa r ew e l lp o s i t i o n e dt oe n g a g ei n meaningful dialogue with patients who have experi- enced an ACS event about secondary prevention and building self-care skills to manage their condition (Table 20 ). Recovery represents a teachable moment to provide structured educatio n, including priming the pa- tient to attend cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Systematic reviews of educational interventions targeting secondary prevention in patients with coronary heart disease, many of whom have ACS, have demonstrated effectiveness in improving disease-related knowledge, healthy behaviors (eg, smoking cessation, physical activity, healthy dietary behavior), and medication adherence. 1-3 The magnitude of the effect on each of these outcomes varies by study. Beyond improved knowledge and behavior change, the impact of individualized education for patients with ACS on morbidity and mortality is less clear. A shortcoming of published educational intervention studies to date is that the interventions are markedly heterogeneous but vary in intensity, duration, delivery mode, resources needed, and outcomes measured. Currently, insuf ﬁcient Recommendation for Noninvasive Diagnostic Testing Prior to Hospital Discharge COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 C-LD 1. In patients with ACS, an assess- ment of LVEF is recommended prior to hospital discharge to guide therapy and for risk strati- ﬁcation. 1-3 JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 Rao et al JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline 2195 comparative data are available to guide clinicians about which speci ﬁc educational interven tions are best. How- ever, evidence supports the use of individualized goal setting that demonstrates respect for the patient and their circumstances, structu red content that is culturally appropriate, and clearly de ﬁned outcomes. 4 Table 20 lists the components that should be discussed with ACS patients at the time of hospital discharge. 10.5.2. Postdischarge Follow-Up and Systems of Care Coordination Synopsis Transition from the hospital to home is a critical period for patients with ACS because approximately 1 in 5 pa- tients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge. 1-6 Women, individuals from traditionally underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and patients who require ICU services during their index hospitalization are particularly at risk for readmission. 3 Quality improvement programs such as the Hospital to Home Initiative 7 or the AMI Toolkit 8 provide resources to assist clinicians decrease readmission rates and improve medication and CR adherence through increase d provider communication and care coordination. Transitional care interventions that leverage different typ es of support (eg, hospital- initiated support, patient and family education deliv- ered before and after discharge, or community-based or chronic disease management models of care) are exam- ples of ways to reduce risk of readmission. 9 Hospital- initiated support interventions are associated with reduced mortality rates at 3 months and 1 year as well as a reduction in 30-day readmission rates among patients with AMI. 9,10 Multicomponent integrated care ($2q u a l i t y improvement strategies targeting different domains of the health care system, health care professionals, or pa- tients) as compared with usual care has been associated with reduction of all-cause death, cardiovascular mortal- ity, and all-cause hospitalization. 11 Emerging digital health interventions hold promise to improve the transi- tion from hospital to home.

Cardiac Rehabilitation Synopsis CR is a multifaceted and comprehensive outpatient intervention that is considered the standard of care for secondary prevention of CVD. The primary goals of CR are modifying CVD risk factors and improving patient func- tional capacity and QOL with the goal of reducing subse- quent morbidity and mortality. Through a combination of monitored exercise training, health and nutrition educa- tion, psychological support, and personalized patient assessment, including me dication optimization (Figure 10), CR has been shown to lower the risk of car- diovascular and all-cause death, reduce hospital read- missions, and to be cost-effective. 10,11 Despite its proven beneﬁts, CR is underutilized and referral rates to CR are low, especially for women and members of traditionally underrepresented groups. 8 Factors that contribute to this overall low enrollment rate include a poor utilization of a centralized method for referral via the electronic health record, inadequate communication between treatment teams, and perceived inconvenience as well as associated costs for the patient. 8 To increase the utilization of CR, patients should be referred to CR during hospitalization for ACS and prior to discharge. 12 To improve access for patients who live in rural locations and in areas with no center-based CR, home-based CR options should be considered. These home-based CR programs have similar shorter-term safety and clinical outcomes (eg, improve- ments in exercise capacity, QOL, blood pressure, choles- terol) as center-based CR. 13-15 More intensive CR programs FIGURE 10 Core Components of Cardiac Rehabilitation Adapted with permission from Sandesara et al.30 Copyright 2015 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

Patients with ACS should be referred to an outpatient CR program prior to hospital discharge to reduce death, MI, hospital readmissions, and improve functional status and QOL. 1-4 2a B-R 2. In patients with ACS, a home- based CR program is a reasonable alternative to a center-based CR program to improve functional status and QOL. 5-9 JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 Rao et al JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline 2197 have been developed with a goal of expanding the bene- ﬁts of traditional CR programs through additional exer- c i s ea n de d u c a t i o ns e s s i o n s ,a sw e l la sp l a c i n gag r e a t e r focus on diet and lifestyle factors. 16-18 Although improved outcomes have been described with an intensive pro- gram, 16,19 the studies are observational in nature. Both traditional and intensive CR programs remain underutil- ized, so the primary emphasis should be on enrollment and adherence to any CR program. 20 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Exercise-based CR programs are associated with improved survival and reduced risk of reinfarction in patients after AMI. 1-4 CR can be enhanced as a component of a multifactorial rehabilitation program with risk factor education and counseling. Patients with ACS who participate in CR have signi ﬁcantly better outcomes compared with those who do not. 1,21,22 In a meta-analysis of 85 RCTs of exercise- b a s e dC Ri np a t i e n t sw i t hc o r o n a r yh e a r td i s e a s e , the intervention reduced risk of MI, reduced all-cause hospitalization, reduced health care costs, and improved health-related QOL outcomes over 12 months of follow-up. 1 Longer follow-up suggested reductions in cardiovascular mortality. 1,4 CR is particularly bene ﬁcial in older patients with CAD, a group that is at a higher risk of losing independence and functioning. 23-26 2. To overcome challenges that have prevented greater patient participation, new strategies and innovative models that utilize digital health tools are emerging to meet the evolving needs of CR patients. CR programs have traditionally been delivered via center-based CR. These programs require patients to be physically pre- sent at a facility located in a hospital or outpatient center, which limits access for many patients, espe- cially women and some racial and ethnic groups. 9,27,28 A review of 23 RCTs of home- and center-based CR found that these programs tend to implement the same core components. 13 These include patient assessment of current medical history, e xercise training, dietary counseling, risk factor management (eg, smoking, lipids, blood pressure, weight, diabetes), and psycho- logical intervention. Comparison of studies in home- and center-based CR indicate a similar improvement in QOL and no statistically signi ﬁcant difference in the all-cause mortality rate up to 12 months after the intervention. 5,6 However, more RCTs are needed with home-based CR in patients with ACS because of an evidence gap (especially in high-risk patients) in assessing the safety of home-based CR in patients at high risk for recurrent ischemic events, as well the impact of a home-based rehabilitation strategy on clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular death, recurrent MI, and rehospitalization. 29 Advances in technology and remote monitoring may help to improve the ef ﬁcacy and safety of this approach. Hybrid models that combine elements of both center- and home-based programs may also offer beneﬁts. 11. DISCHARGE: LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT AND SECONDARY PREVENTION 11.1. DAPT Strategies in the First 12 Months Postdischarge Recommendations for DAPT Strategies in the First 12 Months Postdischarge Referenced studies that support recommendations are summarized in the Evidence Table . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS Default Duration of DAPT 1A 1. In patients with ACS who are not at high bleeding risk, DAPT with aspirin and an oral P2Y12 inhibi- tor should be administered for at least 1 year to reduce MACE. 1-6 Bleeding Reduction Strategies 1A 2. In patients with ACS who have tolerated DAPT with ticagrelor, transition to ticagrelor monotherapy ‡1 month post PCI is useful to reduce bleeding risk. 7-11 1A 3. In patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, a pro- ton pump inhibitor (PPI) is rec- ommended in combination with DAPT, oral anticoagulants, or both to reduce risk of bleeding. 12-15 2b B-R 4. In patients with ACS undergoing PCI, de-escalation of DAPT (switching from ticagrelor or prasugrel to clopidogrel) after 1 month may be reasonable to reduce bleeding risk. 16-20 2b B-R 5. In patients with ACS undergoing PCI who are at high bleeding risk, transition to single antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or P2Y12 inhibi- tor) after 1 month may be reasonable to reduce bleeding risk. 21 Rao et al JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2198 Synopsis The addition of an oral P2Y12 inhibitor to aspirin (DAPT) reduces the risk of early and late thrombotic events among patients with ACS regardless of whether they are managed with an invasive strategy. 1-3 Notwith- standing these salutary bene ﬁts, prolonged exposure to DAPT results in excess bleeding that may lead to DAPT interruption, 22 which in turn may increase the risk of recurrent ischemic events. 23 Identifying individuals most likely to realize a net clinical beneﬁto rh a r mf r o mp r o - longed DAPT has emerged as an important clinical prior- ity. Several tools have been developed that predict the risk of ischemic and/or bleeding events and may be useful when considering how best to personalize care for an in- dividual patient. 24-27 Moreover, alternative antiplatelet strategies have been compare dw i t hc o n v e n t i o n a lD A P T with the intent to reduce bleeding while maintaining ischemic ef ﬁcacy. Growing evidence suggests that a strategy of aspirin discontinuation with ticagrelor mono- therapy reduces bleeding. 7-11 Although clopidogrel mon- otherapy has been studied,28,29 interpatient variability in pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel is substantial30 and may increase thrombotic risk in certain individuals. To that end, a strategy of clopidogrel monotherapy may increase risk of MACE in patients after ACS when compared with more prolonged DAPT. 29 Additional ap- proaches include aspirin monotherapy31,32 or a strategy of “de-escalation ” (ie, switching from ticagrelor or prasugrel to clopidogrel), 16-20 although the safety of these strategies in terms of their effects on risk of MACE is less ﬁrmly established. Efﬁcacy and safety of shorter DAPT strategies have not been rigorously studied in patients not under- going PCI. Figure 11 summarizes the guideline recom- mendations for DAPT management in patients with ACS during the ﬁrst 12 months post discharge. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Patients with ACS are characterized by a sustained prothrombotic state, 33 thus highlighting the need for continued antithromboti c therapy beyond the index presentation. The double-blind placebo-controlled CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events) trial (n ¼ 12,562) demonstrated that DAPT with clopidogrel yields a consistent reduction in both early and late composite ischemic events as compared with aspirin alone among patients with NSTE-ACS who were primarily managed medically. 3,34 The treatment effect was consistent among those t r e a t e dw i t ho rw i t h o u tr e v a s c u l a r i z a t i o n .4 Subsequent studies showed that DAPT with prasugrel or ticagrelor administered for 1 year provides incremental re- ductions in ischemic events, albeit with excess bleeding, as compared with clopidogrel. 1,2 Although concordant bene ﬁts were also observed among trial participants requiring surgical revascularization, the safety and efﬁcacy of DAPT should be considered in the context of CABG as a postrandomization event and the high proportion of patients who did not resume study drug after surgery. 4-6 An important consideration in extending the results of clinical trials that established the beneﬁts of DAPT to contemporary cohorts is that patients at elevated risk for bleeding were typically excluded in early studies. Therefore, the default strategy for a minimum DAPT duration of 1 year is most applicable to those patients without high bleeding risk presenting with ACS. Moreover, the choice of P2Y12 inhibitor may vary in relation to treatment approach, as described in Section 4.3.2 , “Oral P2Y12 Inhibitors During Hospitalization. ” In select patients who have tolerated DAPT, it may be reasonable to extend treat- ment beyond 1 year after considering risks for long- term bleeding and thrombosis. 35-37 2. Results from several randomized trials have consis- tently shown that aspirin withdrawal followed by ticagrelor monotherapy after 1 to 3 months of ticagrelor-based DAPT resu lts in less bleeding without clear excess in MACE, as compared with continued DAPT among patients with ACS undergoing PCI. 7-11 Although studies examining this strategy were char- acterized by relatively low rates of ischemic events, study-level 38 and individual patient data pooled ana- lyses 39-41 have yielded similar results. Although data with clopidogrel have been mixed, concerns have been raised that a strategy of clopidogrel monotherapy started 1 to 2 months after PCI may increase risk of MACE in patients with ACS when compared with longer DAPT. 29 It remains unknown whether this may be explained by excess thrombotic risk in patients dis- playing inadequate platelet inhibition to clopidogrel, observed in 30% to 40% of patients after PCI. 30,42 Re- sults from a randomized trial showed that a strategy of P2Y12 inhibitor discontinuation followed by aspirin alone after 6 months of DAPT resulted in excess thrombotic risk among patients with ACS undergoing JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 Rao et al JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline 2199 PCI (n ¼ 2,712; 38% STEMI), albeit with less bleeding.32 Similar ﬁndings were observed with earlier P2Y12 in- hibitor discontinuation 3 months after PCI. 31,43 Although the on-treatment pharmacodynamic effects of ticagrelor and prasugrel are similar, the safety of prasugrel monotherapy has not been established in patients $1 month post ACS; low-dose prasugrel mon- otherapy (3.75 mg daily) in Japanese patients very early after PCI with ACS or at high bleeding risk may increase 30-day MACE compared with DAPT. 44 3. PPIs reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding among patients receiving aspirin, 14 DAPT, 13 or an oral antico- agulant. 12,15 Because the conversion of clopidogrel to its active metabolite and the metabolism of certain PPIs depend on some common hepatic enzymes (eg, C Y P 2 C 1 9 ) ,t h ep o t e n t i a lf o rad r u g - d r u gi n t e r a c t i o n exists when both agents are coadministered. The re- sults of several ex vivo studies found that clopidogrel- induced platelet inhibition is attenuated with use of certain PPIs, a pharmacodynamic effect that is most pronounced with omeprazole. 45,46 Nonetheless, results from a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial showed no signi ﬁcant differences in ischemic events between omeprazole versus placebo among patients treated with clopidogrel, but PPI use markedly decreased the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. 13 Moreover, post hoc analyses from several randomized trials have shown that ischemic risk is not increased when a clinically indicated PPI is used with clopidog- rel. 47,48 Importantly, the antipla telet effects and clin- ical ef ﬁcacy of ticagrelor and prasugrel are not appreciably modi ﬁed with concomitant PPI use. 48-50 Therefore, it is recommended to administer a PPI in patients with ACS at elevated bleeding risk treated with DAPT or oral anticoagulant. 4. De-escalation implies modulating DAPT intensity by switching from ticagrelor or prasugrel to clopidogrel. 51 De-escalation can be guided by the results of platelet function assays that quantify the degree of platelet inhibition among patients treated with clopidogrel. Patients with adequate response may continue to receive clopidogrel, whereas nonresponders are switched to a more potent P2Y12 inhibitor. Clopidogrel responsiveness may also be inferred with use of gen- otyping assays that identify polymorphisms in genes involved in clopidogrel metabolism. 52 Clinical trials examining guided de-escalation after PCI have either shown a lack of bene ﬁt,16 noninferiority, 20 or re- ductions in minor bleeding 17 versus conventional DAPT. By contrast, unguided de-escalation is per- formed without antecedent knowledge of platelet responsiveness. Randomized trials have suggested that unguided de-escalation 1 month after PCI reduces bleeding without incurring ischemic risk as compared with longer term prasugrel- or ticagrelor-based DAPT. 18,19 Pooled analyses ha ve shown that de- escalation (guided or unguided) yields comparable ef- ﬁcacy to DAPT with respect to ischemic events while reducing bleeding. 53,54 However, trials of ticagrelor and prasugrel have suggested that the beneﬁto fm o r e potent P2Y12 inhibitor therapy extends beyond the early phase post ACS, but with increased bleeding. 1,2,55 5. In the MASTER DAPT (Management of High Bleeding Risk Patients Post Bioresorbable Polymer Coated Stent Implantation With an Abbreviated Versus Standard DAPT Regimen) trial, patients at high risk of bleeding who had completed a 4-week course of DAPT after successful PCI with drug-eluting stents were randomly allocated to single antiplatelet therapy or more pro- longed DAPT ($2 additional months). 21 In the absence of oral anticoagulant use, the choice of discontinuing a s p i r i no rP 2 Y 1 2i n h i b i t o ra n dt h ec h o i c eo fP 2 Y 1 2 TABLE 22 Academic Research Consortium High Bleeding Risk Criteria After PCI Major Criteria 26 Minor Criteria Age $75 y Anticipated use of long-term oral anticoagulation (Section 11.1.1, “Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients on Anticoagulation Postdischarge”) Severe or end-stage CKD (eGFR <30 mL/min) Moderate CKD (eGFR 30-59 mL/min) Hemoglobin level<11 g/dL Hemoglobin level 11-12.9 g/dL for men and 11-11.9 g/dL for women Spontaneous bleeding requiring hospitalization or transfusion in the past 6 mo or at any time, if recurrent Spontaneous bleeding requiring hospitalization or transfusion within the past 12 mo not meeting the major criterion Moderate or severe baseline thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100 /C2 10 9/L) Chronic bleeding diathesis Liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension Long-term use of oral NSAIDs or steroids Active malignancy (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) within the past 12 mo Previous spontaneous ICH (at any time) Previous traumatic ICH within the past 12 mo Presence of a brain arteriovenous malformation Moderate or severe ischemic stroke within the past 6 mo Any ischemic stroke at any time not meeting the major criterion Nondeferrable major surgery on DAPT Recent major surgery or major trauma within 30 d before PCI The presence of at least 1 major or 2 minor criteria helps to identify those at increased risk of bleeding.

COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 B-R 1. In patients with ACS who require oral anticoagulant therapy, aspirin should be discontinued after 1 to 4 weeks of triple antithrombotic therapy, with continued use of a P2Y12 inhibi- tor (preferably clopidogrel) and an oral anticoagulant to reduce bleeding risk. * 1-5 *Modiﬁed from the “2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization.”6 JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 Rao et al JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline 2201 Synopsis Patients after ACS may frequently have indications for anticoagulant therapy, including AF, venous thromboembolism, and prosthetic heart valves. Bleeding risks are increased in the setting of triple therapy with the combination of aspirin, P2Y12 in- hibitor, and anticoagulant. Therefore, the bene ﬁts of these therapies must be weighed against the risk of bleeding. A growing number of studies have demon- strated the overall safety of a strategy of aspirin discontinuation 1 to 4 weeks after ACS or PCI in pa- tients who require anticoagulation after ACS. 1-5 For most patients, a DOAC will be preferred over a vitamin K antagonist due to their favorable ef ﬁcacy and safety pro ﬁle.7 Trials of more potent P2Y12 in- hibitors (ie, prasugrel and ticagrelor) excluded patients requiring long-term anticoag ulation; therefore, clopi- dogrel is generally favored as the P2Y12 inhibitor in this setting for most patients. The decision whether to continue anticoagulant with or without antiplatelet therapy >12 months after ACS is addressed in the “2023 AHA/ACC/ACCP/ASPC/NLA/PCNA Guideline for the Management of Patients with Chronic Coronary Disease. ” 8 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Several RCTs have demonstrated that the discontinua- tion of aspirin 1 to 4 weeks after PCI reduces the risk of bleeding in patients with AF with an indication for DAPT and an oral anticoagulant.1-5 Although individual studies were not powered for ischemic endpoints, m e t a - a n a l y s e sa c r o s sr a n d o m i z e dt r i a l ss u g g e s tn o difference in mortality, stroke, and overall MACE when aspirin is discontinued for patients on an oral antico- agulant, albeit with a marginal apparent increase in MI and stent thrombosis. 9-14 An analysis of stent throm- bosis rates suggested that 80% of events occurred within 30 days of PCI, with stent thrombosis events numerically less frequent in those receiving aspirin (randomization was approximately 1 week after PCI) c o m p a r e dw i t hp l a c e b oi nt h eA U G U S T U S( A n t i t h - rombotic Therapy After Acute Coronary Syndrome or PCI in Atrial Fibrillation) trial. 15,16 Therefore, in pa- tients with a high risk of stent thrombosis, aspirin for up to 30 days after PCI could be considered. P2Y12 in- hibitor therapy should be continued for at least 12 months after PCI following aspirin discontinuation but could be discontinued earlier in those with multiple risk factors for bleeding. 17,18 11.2. Reassessment of Lipid Levels Postdischarge Synopsis Aggressive LDL-C lowering is an important component of secondary CVD prevention. For every 1.0-mmol/L (w39 mg/dL) reduction of LDL-C, an approximate 22% relative reduction in cardiovascular events is observed over a period of 4 to 5 years. 2 Despite the growing number of lipid-lowering therapies currently available, many patients with ACS do not achieve target LDL-C levels. 4,5 The reasons are varied but include underprescribing by providers, cost or insuf ﬁcient coverage by medical in- surance companies, and intolerance to therapies. Many patients are also unwilling or unable to readily ﬁll pre- scriptions at pharmacies or patients self-discontinue therapy early. Providers are not always aware of the bar- riers that patients may be experiencing; therefore, a conversation between clinician and patient is important to help improve adherence. If adverse effects are experi- enced, consideration should be given to subsequent rechallenge at each visit or changing to a different type of statin or class of lipid-lowering therapy. Statin intoler- ance requires exposure to at least 2 different statins with 1 prescribed at the lowest available dose. Because risk of MACE is elevated in the early months after ACS, early follow-up visits are important for making appropriate changes to lipid-lowering therapy to help achieve desired LDL-C targets ( Section 4.5 , “Lipid Management ”). Importantly, lipid-lowering therapies should not be downtitrated in response to very low LDL-C concentra- tions, because current evidence supports that those with very low LDL-C concentrations are at lowest risk of MACE without any clear safety concern. 6-9 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Use of high-potency statin therapy has been shown to reduce MACE with the beneﬁt appearing early after ACS and persisting with time.10 To date, evidence suggests the beneﬁt of lowering LDL-C concentrations may be Recommendation for Reassessment of Lipid Levels Postdischarge COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1 C-LD 1.

As such, early intensi ﬁcation of lipid- lowering therapy after ACS is justi ﬁed. In clinical practice, statin-eligible patients remain undertreated or untreated. 1,11 Early and frequent follow-up, including lipid testing, is associated with improved adherence to lipid-lowering therapies. 1 In the PALM (Provider Assessment of Lipid Management) registry, less than one-half of adults were on the statin intensity recommended by the guidelines. 12 In a study of U.S. veterans with a history of ACS or coronary revascular- ization, less than one-half of patients received inten- siﬁcation of lipid-lowering therapy (41.9% at 3 months versus 47.3% at 1-year postdischarge). 5 High patient copays and poor coverage of newer lipid-lowering therapies by some prescription plans are factors contributing to suboptimal LDL target attainment. To that end, out-of-pocket costs should be veri ﬁed and discussed with patients before they ﬁll a prescription for a new lipid-lowering therapy. Education about the importance of lipid-lowering therapies should be dis- cussed with patients at visits to allow them the op- portunity to ask questions and review potential barriers. For the management of lipid-lowering therapy initiated prior to discharge and continued after hospital discharge, refer to Section 4.5, “Lipid Management. ” 11.3. SGLT-2 Inhibitors and GLP-1 Receptor Agonists Synopsis The cardiovascular bene ﬁts of both sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor ag onists are well documented in stable patients with ASCVD and type 2 diabetes, 1-6 as well as in patients with HF regardless of diabetes status. 7-11 GLP-1 receptor agonists may lead to weight loss in many patients, and semaglutide has been shown to r e d u c et h er i s ko fM A C Ei no v e r w e i g h to ro b e s ep a t i e n t s with stable ASCVD but has not been studied early after ACS. 12 SGLT-2 inhibitors may increase the risk of urinary tract infection, genital myco tic infection, hypovolemia, and acute kidney injury (while offering longer term renal beneﬁt in patients with diabetes). Due to a higher risk of diabetic and euglycemic ketoacidosis in the perioperative period, canagli ﬂozin, dapagli ﬂozin, and empagli ﬂozin should be stopped$3d a y sa n de r t u g l iﬂozin $4d a y sp r i o r to scheduled surgery, including CABG. 13-15 The efﬁcacy and safety of SGLT-2 inhibitors have now been studied in 2 large trials of patients after MI. In pa- tients without diabetes or HF, dapagli ﬂozin was not shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization in patients with AMI and impaired LV systolic function. 16 Similarly, empagli ﬂozin did not signi ﬁcantly reduce all-cause death or ﬁrst HF hospitali- zation in patients without prior HF who were hospitalized with AMI and found to have impaired LV systolic function with or without signs of congestion. However, empagli- ﬂozin did reduce HF hospitalizations in this population. 17 No new safety concerns were identiﬁed. Therefore, use of an SGLT-2 inhibitor does not need to be deferred in pa- tients with an indication for its use at hospital discharge. 11.4. Use of Chronic Colchicine Synopsis Colchicine is a botanical-derived anti-in ﬂammatory agent that has been used for millennia in the treatment of gout. Colchicine reduces neutrophil adhesion to endo- thelial cells and platelets and has been shown to reduce high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration and low-attenuation plaque volume in patients already on aspirin and statin therapy. 6-9 Colchicine is associated with a lower risk of MI in patients with gout, as well as in pa- tients with CAD, including those with prior MI. 1,4,5,10,11 Although gastrointestinal events were historically re- ported at a higher rate in patients on colchicine, this rate does not differ from placebo at the lower once daily dosing. 5 A meta-analysis of the studies examining colchicine in patients with CAD reported no difference in all-cause death with colchicine versus placebo, but a nonsigni ﬁcant trend was observed toward an increased risk of noncardiovascular death that requires further study. 5 To date, no potential pathogeneses of the non- cardiovascular deaths have been consistently shown to explain the numerical differences in noncardiovascular death. 5 Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1.

Although directional consistency was seen across individual components, this bene ﬁtw a sd r i v e n by a reduction in hospitalizations for angina requiring revascularization and stroke. The smaller COPS (Colchicine in Patients With ACS) study randomized patients during their index hospitalization of ACS to colchicine versus placebo. 3 The primary endpoint of all- cause death, ACS, unplanned ischemia-driven urgent revascularization, and noncardioembolic ischemic stroke was numerically, but not signiﬁcantly, lower for patients on colchicine (P ¼ 0.09). Although deaths were infrequent, more deaths occurred for patients on colchicine than on placebo (8 versus 1; P ¼ 0.017) due to more noncardiovascular deaths. In a post hoc analysis, the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, ACS, stroke, or urgent revascularization was lower for colchicine than placebo. The LoDoCo2 (Low- Dose Colchicine-2) trial enrolled patients with stable (>6 months) coronary disease, demonstrating a reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, ischemic stroke, or ischemia-driven coronary revascularization with col chicine (median follow-up, 28.6 months); ﬁndings were consistent in the 84% of patients with prior ACS. 4,12 Pooled data from these large trials con ﬁrmed a reduction in the incidence of MACE with colchicine versus placebo. 5 Colchicine should not be administered in patients with blood dyscrasias, renal failure (creatinine clearance <15 mL/ min), severe hepatic impairment, or with concomitant P-glycoprotein and/or st rong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Although the trials studied a dose of 0.5 mg daily, daily dosing of 0.5 mg or 0.6 mg may be considered. There are ongoing trials studying the ef ﬁcacy of colchicine in patients after MI. 11.5. Immunization Synopsis Inﬂuenza infection is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular morb idity and mortality. 5 Previous studies have shown that in ﬂuenza infection may contribute to atherogenesis and plaque destabilization, thereby precipitating the occurrence of ACS. 6,7 Inﬂuenza vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of death and MACE in patients after ACS and ASC V Da n ds h o u l dt h e r e f o r eb e administered in patients without contraindication. 1-3,5,8 O t h e ri l l n e s s e ss u c ha sC O V I D - 1 9a n dp n e u m o c o c c a l pneumonia increase risk of cardiovascular events and death in patients with ASCVD. However, randomized trial data are lacking to support routine administration of other vaccines for patients at time of hospitalization for ACS. As such, regular immunization schedules are sup- ported for all patients per the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations in the absence of contraindication. 9 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In the FLUVACS (Flu Vaccination in Acute Coronary Syndromes and Planned Percutaneous Coronary In- terventions) study, cardiovascular death was lower in patients who received inﬂuenza vaccination compared with the control group at both 6-month (2% versus 8%) and 1-year follow-up (6% versus 17%). The triple com- posite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and rehospitalization for severe recurrent ischemia at 1 year was signi ﬁcantly lower in the vaccine group c o m p a r e dw i t hc o n t r o l s . 2,10 Among patients admitted with MI or high-risk coronary heart disease, inﬂuenza vaccine administered within 72 hours of an invasive coronary procedure or hospitalization resulted in a lower risk of the composite primary outcome of all- cause death, MI, or stent thrombosis and a lower risk of cardiovascular death compared with placebo at 1 year. 1 12. EVIDENCE GAPS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS The treatment of ACS has been the subject of thousands of clinical trials comprising very large numbers of patients. As such, its management is guided by the largest evidence base in clinical medicine. Despite this, there are numerous unanswered questions, evidence gaps, and areas for further study. Some of these areas have been addressed by observational studies but were not included in this guideline because the LOE was insuf ﬁcient to guide clinical practice. Other areas were not included because they are less well de ﬁned and require more detailed study. This section summarizes some higher priority evidence gaps and areas for future study. Recommendation for Immunization Referenced studies that support recommendation are summarized in the Evidence Table . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION 1A 1. In patients with ACS without a contraindication, annual in ﬂu- enza vaccination is recommended to reduce the risk of death and MACE. 1-4 Rao et al JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2204 INITIAL EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT Although the 2025 ACS guideline recognizes the value of risk scores in estimating the risk of death or recurrent MI, limited prospective randomized data are available as to whether risk scores should be used to determine treat- ment strategies. The highest risk patients are those who present after a cardiac arrest. Although the data support an invasive approach in patients who have been resusci- tated and who have evidence of ST-segment elevation on the postarrest ECG, any potential bene ﬁto fc o r o n a r y angiography may be attenuated in those who are coma- tose. Similarly, it is less clear whether reperfusion with either ﬁbrinolysis or primary PCI provides clinical beneﬁt in patients with ST-segment elevation who present late after symptom onset (12 to 48 hours) but who are no longer symptomatic. Further research is needed to deﬁne the role of coronary angiography and revascularization in these patient subgroups. In-Hospital Management of ACS Patients with ACS are placed on telemetry to monitor for life-threatening arrhythmias or for rhythm disturbances that may require further the rapy (eg, atrioventricular block, AF). Given the length of stay for most patients with ACS has decreased signiﬁc a n t l y ,t h eo p t i m a ld u r a t i o no f telemetry monitoring with contemporary management is unclear. The increasingly rapid triage and timing of invasive risk strati ﬁcation also calls into question the value of “preloading ” of oral P2Y12 inhibitors, with pre- loading deﬁned as administering the loading dose prior to coronary angiography. As ou tlined in this document, clinical trials of preloading have not shown a compelling beneﬁt when coronary angiography occurs rapidly after the patient ’s clinical presentation. Nonetheless, the pharmacodynamic effects of clopidogrel are delayed due to its need to be metabolized to its active metabolite, and there are reports that the antiplatelet effects of all P2Y12 inhibitors may be delayed in patients with STEMI. In this context, parenteral P2Y12 inhibition could be considered but has not yet been compared to a strategy of more potent oral P2Y12 inhibitor administration. Other drug therapies in need of further evaluation in the ACS setting include the utility of sacubitril-valsartan, nonstatin lipid- lowering therapies (including clinical outcome studies for PCSK9 inhibitors early after ACS), and GLP-1 receptor agonists for reducing short- and long-term MACE after ACS. The clinical beneﬁt of beta blockers in the setting of patients with NSTE-ACS requires further study, as well as the optimal duration of their use after ACS. For patients with MVD found during coronary angiog- raphy, there are several remaining gaps in evidence. In patients with NSTEMI, the role of multivessel PCI versus culprit-only PCI needs further supportive data. As a cor- ollary, whether multivessel PCI in the ACS setting should be guided by angiography or physiology is still a matter of debate. Finally, as noted in this guideline, the recom- mendations for PCI of nonculprit arteries in patients with STEMI are for patients who are not intended for CABG, which is a qualiﬁer based on the inclusion criteria of the randomized trials. The optimal strategy for patients who have more complex anatomy is less clear. The 2025 ACS guideline includes a new recommenda- tion regarding the management of cardiogenic shock us- ing the microaxial ﬂow pump MCS device. Because the beneﬁt of this device was offset by an increase in serious complications, more data are needed to guide the selec- tion of patients for MCS, the timing of MCS placement and duration of support, and strategies to reduce the risks of vascular complications, ble eding, and limb ischemia. DISCHARGE STRATEGIES AND SECONDARY PREVENTION One of the most important areas needing further clariﬁ- cation is the timeline deﬁning the transition of a patient from ACS to chronic coronary syndrome. The 2025 ACS guideline does not de ﬁne this largely because no data exist to guide any recommendations. Moreover, it is likely that this transition is highly individualized and accounts for the patient’s risk at initial presentation, the status of residual unrevascularized CAD, control of cardiovascular risk factors, and bleeding risk with continued antith- rombotic therapy. Once a patient is deemed to have JACC VOL. 85, NO. 22, 2025 Rao et al JUNE 10, 2025:2135 – 2237 2025 Acute Coronary Syndromes Management Guideline 2205 transitioned to having a “chronic coronary syndrome, ” the question of how to or whether to de-escalate anti- platelet therapies is unclear. These decisions may also be inﬂuenced by complications of ACS requiring additional antithrombotic therapy such as LV thrombus from a large anterior wall MI. The role of DOACs in this setting appears prudent but is not supported by a robust body of data. Other complications such as post-MI pericarditis now have several therapeutic options, but no comparative data are available to help determine which approach is optimal. With respect to long-term secondary prevention, more research is needed to determine whether home-based CR provides the same beneﬁt as facility-based programs and results in higher rates of adherence. Randomized trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists post MI will be important to un- derstand the role of these agents in reducing long-term risk in patients with diabetes or those who are over- weight or with obesity. Finally, data are lacking on the use of high-dose aspirin in those with post-MI pericarditis, a n da d d i t i o n a ld a t aw o u l db eu s e f u lt oc o nﬁrm the efﬁ- cacy of colchicine post ACS.

EVIDENCE GAPS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS ... e208 APPENDIX 1 Author Relationships With Industry and Other Entities (Relevant)...................... e238 APPENDIX 2 Reviewer Relationships With Industry and Other Entities (Comprehensive) ................ e240 PREAMBLE Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated sci- entiﬁc evidence into clinical practice guidelines (guide- lines) with recommendations to improve cardiovascular health. In 2013, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Advisory Council recommended that the NHLBI focus speci ﬁcally on reviewing the highest- quality evidence and partner with other organizations to develop recommendations (P-1,P-2) .A c c o r d i n g l y ,t h e ACC and AHA collaborated with the NHLBI and stake- holder and professional organizations to complete and publish 4 guidelines (on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle modiﬁcations to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of blood cholesterol in adults, and man- agement of overweight and obesity in adults) to make them available to the widest possible constituency. In 2014, the ACC and AHA, in partnership with several other professional societies, init iated a guideline on the pre- vention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure (BP) in adults. Under the management of the ACC/AHA Task Force, a P revention Subcommittee was appointed to help guide development of the suite of guidelines on prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). These guidelines, which are based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a cornerstone for quality cardiovascular care. The ACC and AHA sponsor the development and publication of guidelines without commercial support, and members of each organization volunteer their time to the writing and review efforts. Guidelines are of ﬁcial policy of the ACC and AHA. Intended Use Practice guidelines provide r ecommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing CVD. The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but guidelines developed in collaboration with other organizations can have a global impact. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, they are inten- ded to improve patients ’ quality of care and align with patients ’ interests. Guidelin es are intended to de ﬁne practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances and should not replace clinical judgment. Clinical Implementation Management in accordance with guideline recommen- dations is effective only when followed by both practi- tioners and patients. Adherence to recommendations can be enhanced by shared decision making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities. Methodology and Modernization The ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines (Task Force) continuously reviews, updates, and modiﬁes guideline methodology on the basis of published stan- dards from organizations, i ncluding the Institute of Medicine (P-3,P-4) , and on the basis of internal reevalu- ation. Similarly, the presentation and delivery of guide- lines are reevaluated and modi ﬁed on the basis of evolving technologies and o ther factors to facilitate optimal dissemination of information to healthcare pro- f e s s i o n a l sa tt h ep o i n to fc a r e . Toward this goal, this guideline continues the intro- duction of an evolved format of presenting guideline recommendations and associated text called the “modular knowledge chunk format. ” Each modular “chunk ” includes a table of related recommendations, a brief synopsis, recommendation-speci ﬁcs u p p o r t i v et e x t , and when appropriate, ﬂow diagrams or additional tables. References are provided within the modular chunk itself to facilitate quick review. Additionally, this format will facilitate seamless updating of guidelines with focused updates as new evidence is published, as well as content tagging for rapid electronic r etrieval of related recom- mendations on a topic of interest. This evolved approach format was instituted when this guideline was near completion; therefore, the present document represents a transitional format that best suits the text as written. Future guidelines will fully implement this format, including provisions for limiting the amount of text in a guideline. Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e130 Recognizing the importance of cost –value consider- ations in certain guidelines, when appropriate and feasible, an analysis of the value of a drug, device, or intervention may be perform ed in accordance with the ACC/AHA methodology (P-5) . To ensure that guideline recommendations remain c u r r e n t ,n e wd a t aa r er e v i e w e do na no n g o i n gb a s i s , with full guideline revisions commissioned in approxi- mately 6-year cycles. Publication of new, potentially practice-changing study results that are relevant to an existing or new drug, device, or management strategy will prompt evaluation by the Task Force, in con- sultation with the relevant guideline writing commit- tee, to determine whether a focused update should be commissioned. For additional information and policies regarding guideline development, we encourage readers to consult the ACC/AHA guideline methodology manual (P-6) and other methodology articles (P-7— P-10) . Selection of Writing Committee Members The Task Force strives to avoid bias by selecting experts from a broad array of backg rounds. Writing committee members represent different geographic regions, sexes, ethnicities, races, intellectual perspectives/biases, and scopes of clinical practice. The Task Force may also invite organizations and professional societies with related in- terests and expertise to participate as partners, collabo- rators, or endorsers. Relationships With Industry and Other Entities The ACC and AHA have rigorous policies and methods to ensure that guidelines are developed without bias or improper in ﬂuence. The complete relationships with in- dustry and other entities (RWI) policy can be found online . Appendix 1 of the present document lists writing committee members ’ relevant RWI. For the purposes of full transparency, writing committee members ’ compre- hensive disclosure information is available online Comprehensive disclosure information for the Task Force is available online . Evidence Review and Evidence Review Committees In developing recommendations, the writing com- mittee uses evidence-based methodologies that are based on all available data (P-6— P-9).L i t e r a t u r e searches focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include registries , nonrandomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and exp ert opinion. Only key ref- erences are cited. An independent evidence review committee (ERC) is commissioned when there are 1 or more questions deemed of utmost clinical importance that merit formal systematic review. The systematic review will determine which patients are most likely to beneﬁtf r o m a drug, device, or treatment strategy and to what degree. Criteria for commissioning an ERC and formal systematic review include: a) the absence of a current authoritative systematic review, b) the feasibility of de ﬁning the beneﬁt and risk in a time frame consistent with the writing of a guideline, c) the relevance to a substantial number of patients, and d) the likelihood that the ﬁnd- ings can be translated into actionable recommendations. ERC members may include methodologists, epidemiolo- gists, healthcare providers, and biostatisticians. The recommendations developed by the writing committee on the basis of the systematic review are marked with “SR”. Guideline-Directed Management and Therapy The term guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT) encompasses clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, and pharmacological and procedural treatments. For these and all recommended drug treatment regi- mens, the reader should con ﬁr mt h ed o s a g eb yr e v i e w - ing product insert material and evaluate the treatment regimen for contraindicati ons and interactions. The recommendations are limited to drugs, devices, and treatments approved for clinical use in the United States. Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence The Class of Recommendation (COR) indicates the strength of the recommendation, encompassing the estimated magnitude and certainty of bene ﬁti np r o - portion to risk. The Level of Evidence (LOE) rates the quality of scienti ﬁ c evidence that supports the inter- vention on the basis of the type, quantity, and consis- tency of data from clinical trials and other sources (Table 1) (P-6— P-8).

INTRODUCTION As early as the 1920s, and subsequently in the 1959 B u i l da n dB l o o dP r e s s u r eS t u d y(S1.5-1) of almost 5 million adults insured between 1934 and 1954, a strong direct relationship was noted between level of BP and risk of clinical complications and death. In the 1960s, these ﬁndings were con ﬁrmed in a series of reports from the Framingham Heart Study (S1.5-2) . The 1967 and 1970 Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group reports ushered in the era of effective treatment for high BP (S1.5-3,S1.5-4) .T h e ﬁrst comprehensive guideline for detection, evaluation, and management of high BP was published in 1977, under the sponsorship of the NHLBI (S1.5-5) . In subsequent years, a series of Joint National Committee (JNC) BP guidelines were published to assist the practice community and improve prevention, awareness, tre atment, and control of high BP (S1.5-5 — S1.5-7) . The present guideline updates prior JNC reports. 1.1. Methodology and Evidence Review An extensive evidence review, which included literature derived from research invol ving human subjects, pub- lished in English, and indexed in MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline, was conducted between February and August 2015. Key search words included but were not limited to the following: adher- ence; aerobic; alcohol intake ; ambulatory care; antihyper- tensive: agents, drug, medication, therapy; beta adrenergic blockers; blood pressure: arterial, control, determination, devices, goal, high, improve, measurement, monitoring, ambulatory; calcium channel blockers; diet; diuretic agent; drug therapy; heart failure: diastolic, systolic; hypertension: white coat, masked, ambulatory, isolated ambulatory, isolated clinic, di agnosis, reverse white coat, prevention, therapy, treatment, control; intervention; lifestyle: measures, modi ﬁcation; of ﬁce visits; patient outcome; performance measures; physical activity; potas- sium intake; protein intake; renin inhibitor; risk reduction: behavior, counseling; screening; sphygmomanometers; spironolactone; therapy; treatment: adherence, compli- ance, ef ﬁcacy, outcome, protocol, regimen; weight. Addi- tional relevant studies published through June 2016, during the guideline writing process, were also consid- ered by the writing committeeand added to the evidence tables when appropriate. The ﬁnal evidence tables included in the Online Data Supplement summarize the evidence used by the writing committee to formulate recommendations. As noted in the preamble, an independent ERC was commissioned to perform a formal systematic review of 4 critical clinical questions related to hypertension (Table 2 ), the results of which were considered by the writing committee for incorporation into this guideline. Concurrent with this process, writing committee members evaluated other published data relevant to the guideline. The ﬁndings of the ERC and the writing committee members were formally presented and discussed, and then guideline recommendations were developed. The systematic review report, “Systematic Review for the 2017 ACC/AHA/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/AGS/ APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA Guideline for the Preven- tion, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults, ” is published in conjunction with this guideline (S1.5-8) ,a n di t sr e s p e c t i v ed a t as u p - plements are available online . No writing committee member reported a RWI. Drs. Whelton, Wright, and Williamson had leadership roles in SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial). Dr. Carey chaired committee discussions in which the SPRINT results were considered. 1.2. Organization of the Writing Committee The writing committee consisted of clinicians, cardiolo- gists, epidemiologists, internists, an endocrinologist, a TABLE 2 Systematic Review Questions on High BP in Adults Question Number Question Section Number 1 Is there evidence that self-directed monitoring of BP and/or ambulatory BP monitoring are superior to ofﬁce-based measurement of BP by a healthcare worker for 1) preventing adverse outcomes for which high BP is a risk factor and 2) achieving better BP control? 4.2 2 What is the optimal target for BP lowering during antihypertensive therapy in adults? 8.1.5 9.3 9.6 3 In adults with hypertension, do various antihypertensive drug classes differ in their comparative beneﬁts and harms? 8.1.6 8.2 4 In adults with hypertension, does initiating treatment with antihypertensive pharmacological monotherapy versus initiating treatment with 2 drugs (includingﬁxed-dose combination therapy), either of which may be followed by the addition of sequential drugs, differ in comparative beneﬁts and/or harms on speciﬁc health outcomes? 8.1.6.1 BP indicates blood pressure.

Scope of the Guideline The present guideline is intended to be a resource for the clinical and public health practice communities. It is designed to be comprehensive but succinct and practical in providing guidance for prevention, detection, evalu- ation, and management of high BP. It is an update of the NHLBI publication, “The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evalua- tion and Treatment of High Blood Pressure ” (JNC 7) (S1.5-7) . It incorporates new information from studies of ofﬁce-based BP-related risk of CVD, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM), telemed icine, and various other areas. This guideline does not address the use of BP-lowering medications for the purposes of prevention of recurrent CVD events in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) or chronic heart failure (HF) in the absence of hypertension; these topics are the focus of other ACC/AHA guidelines (S1.5-9,S1.5-10) . In developing the present guideline, the writing committee reviewed prior published guidelines, evidence reviews, and related statements.

Although the relative risk of incident CVD associated with higher SBP and DBP is smaller at older ages, the corresponding high BP – related increase in absolute risk is larger in older persons ($65 years) given the higher absolute risk of CVD at an older age (S2.1-1) . 2.2. BP Components Epidemiological studies have evaluated associations of SBP and DBP, as well as derived components of BP measurements (including pulse pressure, mean BP, and mid-BP), with CVD outcomes ( Table 4 ). When consid- ered separately, higher levels of both SBP and DBP have been associated with increased CVD risk (S2.2-1,S2.2-2) . Higher SBP has consistent ly been associated with i n c r e a s e dC V Dr i s ka f t e ra d j u s t m e n tf o r ,o rw i t h i ns t r a t a of, DBP (S2.2-3 — S2.2-5) . In contrast, after consideration of SBP through adjustment or strati ﬁcation, DBP has not been consistently associated with CVD risk (S2.2-6,S2.2-7) .A l t h o u g hp u l s ep r e s s u r ea n dm i d - B P have been associated with increased CVD risk indepen- dent of SBP and DBP in some studies, SBP (especially) and DBP are prioritized in the present document because of the robust evidence base for these measures in both observational studies and clinical trials and because of their ease of measurement in practice settings (S2.2-8 — S2.2-11) . 2.3. Population Risk In 2010, high BP was the leading cause of death and disability-adjusted life years worldwide (S2.3-1,S2.3-2) .I n the United States, hypertension (see Section 3.1 for deﬁ- nition) accounted for more CVD deaths than any other modiﬁable CVD risk factor and was second only to ciga- rette smoking as a preventable cause of death for any reason (S2.3-3) . In a follow-up study of 23,272 U.S. NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) participants, >50% of deaths from coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke occurred among individuals with hypertension (S2.3-4) . Because of the high prevalence of hypertension and its associated increased risk of CHD, stroke, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the population-attributable risk of these outcomes associated with hypertension is high (S2.3-4,S2.3-5) .I nt h e population-based ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Commu- nities) study, 25% of the cardiovascular events (CHD, coronary revascularization, stroke, or HF) were attribut- able to hypertension. In the Northern Manhattan study, the percentage of events attributable to hypertension was h i g h e ri nw o m e n( 3 2 % )t h a ni nm e n( 1 9 % )a n dh i g h e ri n b l a c k s( 3 6 % )t h a ni nw h i t e s( 2 1 % )(S2.3-6) .I n2 0 1 2 ,h y - pertension was the second leading assigned cause of ESRD, behind diabetes mellitus (DM), and accounted for 34% of incident ESRD cases in the U.S. population(S2.3-7) . 2.4.

Not only are CVD risk factors common among adults with hypertension, a higher percentage of adults with CVD risk factors have hypertension. For example, 71% of U.S. adults with diagnosed DM have hypertension (S2.4-4) .I nt h eC h r o n i cR e n a lI n s u fﬁciency Cohort (CRIC), 86% of the participants had hypertension (S2.4-5) .A l s o , 28.1% of adults with hypertension and CKD in the population-based REGARDS (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke) study had apparent resistant hypertension (S2.4-6) .I nN H A N E S1 9 9 9–2010, 35.7% of obese individuals had hypertension (S2.4-7) .T h ep r e s - ence of multiple CVD risk factors in individuals with hy- pertension results in high absolute risks for CHD and stroke in this population. For example, among U.S. adults with hypertension between 2009 and 2012, 41.7% had a 10-year CHD risk >20%, 40.9% had a risk of 10% to 20%, a n do n l y1 8 . 4 %h a dar i s k<10% (S2.4-3) . Modiﬁable risk factors for CVD that are common among adults with hypertension include cigarette smoking/ tobacco smoke exposure, DM, dyslipidemia (including high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or hypercholesterolemia, high levels of triglycerides, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), over- weight/obesity, physical inactivity/low ﬁtness level, and unhealthy diet (S2.4-8) . The relationship between hypertension and other modiﬁa b l er i s kf a c t o r si sc o m p l e x and interdependent, with several sharing mechanisms of action and pathophysiology. CVD risk factors affect BP through over activation of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system, activation of the sympathetic ner- vous system, inhibition of the cardiac natriuretic peptide system, endothelial dysfunction, and other mechanisms (S2.4-9 — S2.4-11) . Treating some of the other modi ﬁable risk factors may reduce BP through modiﬁcation of shared pathology, and CVD risk may be reduced by treating global risk factor burden.

COR LOE RECOMMENDATION I B-NR 1. BP should be categorized as normal, elevated, or stage 1 or 2 hypertension to prevent and treat high BP (Table 6) (S3.1-1 — S3.1-20) . Synopsis Although a continuous association exists between higher BP and increased CVD risk (see Section 2.1 ), it is useful to categorize BP levels for clinical and public health decision making. In the present document, BP is catego- rized into 4 levels on the basis of average BP measured in a healthcare setting (of ﬁce pressures): normal, elevated, and stage 1 or 2 hypertension ( Table 6 ). Online Data Supplement C illustrates schematically the SBP and DBP categories de ﬁning normal BP, elevated BP, and stages 1 and 2 hypertension. This categorization differs from that previously recommended in the JNC 7 report, with stage JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e137 1h y p e r t e n s i o nn o wd eﬁned as an SBP of 130–139 or a DBP of 80–89 mm Hg, and with stage 2 hypertension in the present document corresponding to stages 1 and 2 in the JNC 7 report(S3.1-21) . The rationale for this categorization is based on observational data related to the association between SBP/DBP and CVD risk, RCTs of lifestyle modi- ﬁcation to lower BP, and RCTs of treatment with antihy- pertensive medication to prevent CVD. The increased risk of CVD among adults with stage 2 hypertension is well established. An increasing number of individual studies and meta-analyses of observational data have reported a gradient of progressively h igher CVD risk going from normal BP to elevated BP and stage 1 hypertension(S3.1- 4–S3.1-10,S3.1-12,S3.1-13,S3.1-16) .I nm a n yo ft h e s em e t a - analyses, the hazard ratios for CHD and stroke were between 1.1 and 1.5 for the comparison of SBP/DBP of 120– 129/80 –84 mm Hg versus<120/80 mm Hg and between 1.5 and 2.0 for the comparison of SBP/DBP of 130–139/85 –89 mm Hg versus <120/80 mm Hg. This risk gradient was consistent across subgroups de ﬁn e db ys e xa n dr a c e / ethnicity. The relative increase in CVD risk associated with higher BP was attenuated but still present among older adults (S3.1-1) . The prevalence of severe hyperten- sion has been declining over time, but approximately 12.3% of U.S. adults with hypertension have an average SBP $160 mm Hg or average DBP$100 mm Hg (S3.1-22) . Lifestyle modi ﬁcation and pharmacological antihyper- tensive treatment recommendations for individuals with elevated BP and stages 1 and 2 hypertension are provided in Sections 6 and 8, respectively. The relationship of this classi ﬁcation schema with measurements obtained by ambulatory BP recording and home BP measurements is discussed in Section 4.2. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. As was the case in previous BP classiﬁcation systems, t h ec h o i c ea n dt h en a m i n go ft h ec a t e g o r i e sw e r eb a s e d on a pragmatic interpretation of BP-related CVD risk and bene ﬁt of BP reduction in clinical trials. Meta- analyses of observational studies have demonstrated that elevated BP and hypertension are associated with increased risk of CVD, ESRD, subclinical athero- sclerosis, and all-cause death (S3.1-1 — S3.1-17) .T h er e c - ommended BP classiﬁcation system is most valuable in untreated adults as an aid in decisions about preven- tion or treatment of high BP. However, it is also useful in assessing the success of interventions to reduce BP. 3.2. Lifetime Risk of Hypertension Observational studies have documented a relatively high incidence of hypertension over periods of 5 to 10 years of follow-up (S3.2-1,S3.2-2) . Thus, there is a much higher l o n g - t e r mp o p u l a t i o nb u r d e no fh y p e r t e n s i o na sB Pp r o - gressively increases with age. Several studies have esti- mated the long-term cumulative incidence of developing hypertension (S3.2-3,S3.2-4) .I na na n a l y s i so f1 1 3 2w h i t e male medical students (mean age: approximately 23 years at baseline) in the Johns Hopkins Precursors study, 0.3%, 6.5%, and 37% developed hypertension at age 25, 45, and 65 years, respectively (S3.2-5) . In MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), the percentage of the popula- tion developing hypertensi on over their lifetimes was higher for African Americans and Hispanics than for whites and Asians (S3.2-3) . For adults 45 years of age without hypertension, the 40-year risk of developing hypertension was 93% for African-American, 92% for H i s p a n i c ,8 6 %f o rw h i t e ,and 84% for Chinese adults (S3.2-3) . In the Framingham Heart Study, approximately 90% of adults free of hypertension at age 55 or 65 years developed hypertension during their lifetimes (S3.2-4) . All of these estimates were based on use of the 140/90– mm Hg cutpoint for recognition of hypertension and would have been higher had the 130/80–mm Hg cutpoint been used. 3.3. Prevalence of High BP Prevalence estimates are greatly inﬂuenced by the choice of cutpoints to categorize high BP, the methods used to establish the diagnosis, and the population studied (S3.3-1,S3.3-2) . Most general population prevalence esti- mates are derived from national surveys.Table 7 provides estimates for prevalence of hypertension in the U.S. gen- eral adult population ($20 years of age) that are based on the deﬁnitions of hypertension recommended in the pre- sent guideline and in the JNC 7 report. The prevalence of hypertension among U.S. adults is substantially higher when the deﬁnition in the present guideline is used versus the JNC 7 de ﬁnition (46% versus 32%). However, as described in Section 8.1 , nonpharmacological treatment (not antihypertensive medication) is recommended for most U.S. adults who have hypertension as deﬁned in the present guideline but who would not meet the JNC 7 deﬁnition for hypertension. As a consequence, the new TABLE 6 Categories of BP in Adults * BP Category SBP DBP Normal <120 mm Hg and <80 mm Hg Elevated 120–129 mm Hg and <80 mm Hg Hypertension Stage 1 130 –139 mm Hg or 80 –89 mm Hg Stage 2 $140 mm Hg or $90 mm Hg *Individuals with SBP and DBP in 2 categories should be designated to the higher BP category. BP indicates blood pressure (based on an average of$2 careful readings obtained on $2 occasions, as detailed inSection 4); DBP, diastolic blood pressure; and SBP, systolic blood pressure.

The prevalence of hypertension rises dramatically with increasing age and is higher in blacks than in whites, Asians, and Hispanic Americans. NHANES estimates of JNC 7–deﬁned hypertension prevalence have remained fairly stable since the early 2000s (S3.3-1) .M o s tc o n t e m - porary population surveys, including NHANES, rely on an average of BP measurements obtained at a single visit (S3.3-2) , which is likely to result in an overestimate of hypertension prevalence compared with what would be found by using an average of $2 readings taken on $2 visits (S3.3-1) , as recommended in current and previous BP guidelines (S3.3-3 — S3.3-5) . The extent to which guideline recommendations for use of BP averages from $2 occasions is followed in practice is unclear. Adding self-report of previously diagnosed hypertension yields a 5% to 10% higher estimate of prevalence (S3.3-1,S3.3-6,S3.3-7) . Most individuals who were added by use of this expanded deﬁnition have been diagnosed as having hypertension by a health professional on >1 occasion, and many have been advised to change their lifestyle (S3.3-2,S3.3-6) . 3.4. Awareness, Treatment, and Control Prevalence estimates for awareness, treatment, and con- trol of hypertension are usually based on self-reports of the hypertension diagnosis (awareness), use of BP-lowering medications in those with hypertension (treatment), and achievement of a satisfactory SBP/DBP during treatment of hypertension (control). Befo re the present publication, awareness and treatment in adults were based on the SBP/ DBP cutpoints of 140/90 mm Hg, and control was based on an SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg. In the U.S. general adult population, hypertension awareness, treatment, and control have been steadily improving since the 1960s (S3.4-1 — S3.4-4) , with NHANES 2009 to 2012 prevalence estimates for men and women, respectively, being 80.2% and 85.4% for awareness, 70.9% and 80.6% for treatment (88.4% and 94.4% in those who were aware), 69.5% and 68.5% for control in those being treated, and 49.3% and 55.2% for overall control in adults with hypertension (S3.4-5) . The NHANES experience may underestimate awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension because it is based on BP estimates derived from an average of readings obtained at a single visit, whereas guidelines recommend use of BP averages of $2r e a d i n g so b t a i n e d on $2 occasions. In addition, the current de ﬁnition of control excludes the possibility of control resulting from lifestyle change or nonpharm acological interventions. NHANES hypertension control rates have been consis- t e n t l yh i g h e ri nw o m e nt h a ni nm e n( 5 5 . 3 %v e r s u s3 8 . 0 %i n 2009–2012); in whites than in blacks and Hispanics (41.3% versus 31.1% and 23.6%, respectively, in men, and 57.2% versus 43.2% and 52.9%, respectively, in women, for 2009– 2012); and in older than in younger adults (50.5% in adults $60 years of age versus 34.4% in patients 18 to 39 years of age for 2011 –2012) up to the seventh decade (S3.4-4,S3.4-5) , although control rates are considerably lower for those $75 years (46%) and only 39.8% for adults $80 years (S3.4-6) . In addition, control rates are higher for persons of higher socioeconomic status (43.2% for adults with an income >400% above the U.S. TABLE 7 Prevalence of Hypertension Based on 2 SBP/DBP Thresholds *† SBP/DBP $130/80 mm Hg or Self-Reported Antihypertensive Medication † SBP/DBP $140/90 mm Hg or Self-Reported Antihypertensive Medication ‡ Overall, crude 46% 32% Men (n¼4717) Women (n ¼4906) Men (n ¼4717) Women (n ¼4906) Overall, age-sex adjusted 48% 43% 31% 32% Age group, y 20–44 30% 19% 11% 10% 45–54 50% 44% 33% 27% 55–64 70% 63% 53% 52% 65–74 77% 75% 64% 63% 75þ 79% 85% 71% 78% Race-ethnicity§ Non-Hispanic white 47% 41% 31% 30% Non-Hispanic black 59% 56% 42% 46% Non-Hispanic Asian 45% 36% 29% 27% Hispanic 44% 42% 27% 32% The prevalence estimates have been rounded to the nearest full percentage. *130/80 and 140/90 mm Hg in 9623 participants ($20 years of age) in NHANES 2011–2014. †BP cutpoints for deﬁnition of hypertension in the present guideline.‡BP cutpoints for deﬁnition of hypertension in JNC 7. §Adjusted to the 2010 age-sex distribution of the U.S. adult population.

Accurate Measurement of BP in the Ofﬁce Recommendation for Accurate Measurement of BP in the Ofﬁce COR LOE RECOMMENDATION I C-EO 1. For diagnosis and management of high BP, proper methods are recommended for accurate measurement and documentation of BP (Table 8). Synopsis Although measurement of BP in of ﬁce settings is relatively easy, errors are common and can result in a misleading estimation of an individual ’s true level of BP. There are various methods for measuring BP in the of- ﬁce. The clinical standard of auscultatory measures calibrated to a column of mercury has given way to oscillometric devices (in part because of toxicological issues with mercury). Oscillometric devices use a sensor that detects oscillations in pulsatile blood volume during cuff in ﬂation and de ﬂation. BP is indirectly calculated from maximum amplitude algorithms that involve population-based data. For this reason, only devices with a validated measurement protocol can be recommended for use (see Section 4.2 for additional details). Many of the newer oscillometric devices automatically in ﬂate multiple times (in 1- to 2-minute intervals), allowing patients to be alone and undi sturbed during measure- ment. Although much of the available BP-related risk information and antihypertensive treatment trial expe- rience have been generated by using “traditional ” ofﬁce methods of BP measurement, there is a growing evidence base supporting the use of automated of ﬁce BP mea- surements (S4.1-1) . TABLE 8 Checklist for Accurate Measurement of BP (S4.1-3,S4.1-4) Key Steps for Proper BP Measurements Speci ﬁc Instructions Step 1: Properly prepare the patient 1. Have the patient relax, sitting in a chair (feet onﬂoor, back supported) for >5m i n . 2. The patient should avoid caffeine, exercise, and smoking for at least 30 min before measurement. 3. Ensure patient has emptied his/her bladder. 4. Neither the patient nor the observer should talk during the rest period or during the measurement. 5. Remove all clothing covering the location of cuff placement. 6. Measurements made while the patient is sitting or lying on an examining table do not fulﬁll these criteria. Step 2: Use proper technique for BP measurements 1. Use a BP measurement device that has been validated, and ensure that the device is calibrated periodically.* 2. Support the patient’s arm (e.g., resting on a desk). 3. Position the middle of the cuff on the patient’s upper arm at the level of the right atrium (the midpoint of the sternum). 4. Use the correct cuff size, such that the bladder encircles 80% of the arm, and note if a larger- or smaller-than-normal cuff size is used (Table 9). 5. Either the stethoscope diaphragm or bell may be used for auscultatory readings(S4.1-5,S4.1-6) . Step 3: Take the proper measurements needed for diagnosis and treatment of elevated BP/hypertension 1. At the ﬁrst visit, record BP in both arms. Use the arm that gives the higher reading for subsequent readings. 2. Separate repeated measurements by 1–2m i n . 3. For auscultatory determinations, use a palpated estimate of radial pulse obliteration pressure to estimate SBP. Inﬂate the cuff 20–30 mm Hg above this level for an auscultatory determination of the BP level. 4. For auscultatory readings, deﬂate the cuff pressure 2 mm Hg per second, and listen for Korotkoff sounds. Step 4: Properly document accurate BP readings 1. Record SBP and DBP. If using the auscultatory technique, record SBP and DBP as onset of theﬁrst Korotkoff sound and disappearance of all Korotkoff sounds, respectively, using the nearest even number. 2. Note the time of most recent BP medication taken before measurements. Step 5: Average the readings Use an average of $2 readings obtained on$2 occasions to estimate the individual’s level of BP. Step 6: Provide BP readings to patient Provide patients the SBP/DBP readings both verbally and in writing. *See Section 4.2for additional guidance.

JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e140 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Accurate measurement and recording of BP are essential to categorize level of BP, ascertain BP-related CVD risk, and guide management of high BP. Most systematic er- rors in BP measurement can beavoided by following the suggestions provided in Table 8, including having the patient sit quietly for 5 minutes before a reading is taken, supporting the limb used to measure BP, ensuring the BP cuff is at heart level, using the correct cuff size (Table 9), and, for auscultatory readings, deﬂating the cuff slowly (S4.1-2) . In those who are already taking medication that affects BP, the timing of BP measurements in relation to ingestion of the patient ’s medication should be stan- dardized. Because individual BP measurements tend to vary in an unpredictable or random fashion, a single reading is inadequate for clinical decision-making. An average of 2 to 3 BP measurements obtained on 2 to 3 separate occasions will mi nimize random error and provide a more accurate basis for estimation of BP. In addition to clinicians, other caregivers and patients who perform BP self-monitoring should be trained to follow the checklist in Table 8 . Common errors in clinical practice that can lead to inaccurate estimation of BP include failure to allow for a rest period and/or talking with the patient during or immediately before the recording, improper patient positioning (e.g., sitting or lying on an examination table), rapid cuff deﬂation (for auscultatory readings), and reliance on BPs measured at a single occasion. 4.2.

BP indicates blood pressure. Recommendation for Out-of-Of ﬁce and Self-Monitoring of BP References that support the recommendation are summarized in Online Data Supplement 3 and Systematic Review Report. COR LOE RECOMMENDATION IA SR 1. Out-of-of ﬁce BP measurements are recommended to conﬁrm the diagnosis of hypertension (Table 11) and for titration of BP-lowering medication, in conjunction with telehealth counseling or clinical interventions (S4.2-1 — S4.2-4) . SR indicates systematic review. Synopsis Out-of-of ﬁce measurement of BP can be helpful for conﬁrmation and management of hypertension. Self- monitoring of BP refers to the regular measurement of BP by an individual at home or elsewhere outside the clinic setting. Among individuals with hypertension, self- monitoring of BP, without other interventions, has shown limited evidence for treatment-related BP reduction and achievement of BP control (S4.2-1,S4.2-5,S4.2-6) .H o w e v - er, with the increased recognition of inconsistencies be- tween ofﬁce and out-of-of ﬁce BPs (see Section 4.4 )a n d greater reduction in BP being recommended for hyper- tension control, increased attention is being paid to out- of-of ﬁce BP readings. Although ABPM is generally accepted as the best out-of-of ﬁce measurement method, HBPM is often a more practical approach in clinical prac- tice. Recommended procedures for the collection of HBPM data are provided inTable 10. If self-monitoring is used, it i si m p o r t a n tt oe n s u r et h a tt h eB Pm e a s u r e m e n td e v i c e used has been validated with an internationally accepted protocol and the results have been published in a peer- reviewed journal (S4.2-7) . A guide to the relationship be- tween HBPM BP readings and corresponding readings obtained in the of ﬁce and by ABPM is presented in Table 11 . The precise relationships between of ﬁce read- ings, ABPM, and HBPM are unsettled, but there is general agreement that ofﬁce BPs are often higher than ABPM or HBPM BPs, especially at higher BPs. Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. ABPM is used to obtain out-of-ofﬁce BP readings at set intervals, usually over a period of 24 hours. HBPM is used to obtain a record of out-of-of ﬁce BP readings taken by a patient. Both ABPM and HBPM typically provide BP estimates that are based on multiple mea- surements. A systematic review conducted by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reported that ABPM provided a better method to predict long-term CVD outcomes than did of ﬁce BPs. It incorporates new JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e141 information from studies of HBPM, ABPM, the rela- tionship of overall CVD risk to the effectiveness of blood pressure lowering, clinical outcomes related to different blood pressure goals, strategies to improve blood pressure control and various other areas. A small body of evidence suggested, but did not conﬁrm, that HBPM could serve as a similar predictor of outcomes (S4.2-4) . Meta-analyses of RCTs have identi ﬁed clinically useful reductions in SBP and DBP and achievement of BP goals at 6 months and 1 year when self-monitoring of BP has been used in conjunction with other interventions, compared with usual care. Meta-analyses of RCTs have identi ﬁed only small net reductions in SBP and DBP at 6 months and 1 year for use of self-monitoring of BP on its own, as compared with usual care (S4.2-1,S4.2-5,S4.2-6) .S e eSection 4.4 for additional details of diagnostic classi ﬁcation and Section 12 for additional details of telehealth and out- of-of ﬁce BP measurement for management of high BP. 4.3. Ambulatory BP Monitoring A l lo ft h em a j o rR C T sh a v eb e e nb a s e do nu s eo fc l i n i cB P readings. However, ABPM is often used to supplement BP readings obtained in ofﬁce settings (S4.3-1) .T h em o n i t o r s are usually programmed to obtain readings every 15 to 30 minutes throughout the day and every 15 minutes to 1 hour during the night. ABPM is conducted while in- dividuals go about their normal daily activities. ABPM can a) provide estimates of mean BP over the entire moni- toring period and separately during nighttime and day- time, b) determine the daytime-to-nighttime BP ratio to identify the extent of nocturnal“dipping, ” c) identify the early-morning BP surge pattern, d) estimate BP vari- ability, and e) allow for recognition of symptomatic hy- potension. The U.S. Cente rs for Medicaid & Medicare Services and other agencies provide reimbursement for ABPM in patients with suspected white coat hypertension (S4.3-2) . Medicare claims for ABPM between 2007 and 2010 were reimbursed at a median of $52 and were TABLE 10 Procedures for Use of HBPM (S4.2-8 — S4.2-10) Patient training should occur under medical supervision, including: n Information about hypertension n Selection of equipment n Acknowledgment that individual BP readings may vary substantially n Interpretation of results Devices: n Verify use of automated validated devices. Use of auscultatory devices (mercury, aneroid, or other) is not generally useful for HBPM because patientsr a r e l y master the technique required for measurement of BP with auscultatory devices. n Monitors with provision for storage of readings in memory are preferred. n V e r i f yu s eo fa p p r o p r i a t ec u f fs i z et oﬁtt h ea r m(Table 9). n Verify that left/right inter-arm differences are insigniﬁcant. If differences are signiﬁcant, instruct patient to measure BPs in the arm with higher readings. Instructions on HBPM procedures: n Remain still: n Avoid smoking, caffeinated beverages, or exercise within 30 min before BP measurements. n Ensure $5 min of quiet rest before BP measurements. n Sit correctly: n Sit with back straight and supported (on a straight-backed dining chair, for example, rather than a sofa). n Sit with feet ﬂat on theﬂoor and legs uncrossed. n Keep arm supported on aﬂat surface (such as a table), with the upper arm at heart level. n Bottom of the cuff should be placed directly above the antecubital fossa (bend of the elbow). n Take multiple readings: n Take at least 2 readings 1 min apart in morning before taking medications and in evening before supper. Optimally, measure and record BP daily. Ideally, obtain weekly BP readings beginning 2 weeks after a change in the treatment regimen and during the week before a clinic visit. n Record all readings accurately: n Monitors with built-in memory should be brought to all clinic appointments. n BP should be based on an average of readings on$2 occasions for clinical decision making.

ABPM and HBPM deﬁnitions of high BP use different BP thresholds than those used by the previously mentioned ofﬁce-based approach to categorize high BP identi ﬁed in Section 3.1 . Table 11 provides best estimates for corresponding home, daytime, nighttime, and 24-hour ambulatory levels of BP, including the values recom- mended for identi ﬁcation of hypertension with of ﬁce measurements.

These thresholds are based on data from European, Australian, and Asian populations, with few data available for establishing appropriate thresholds for U.S. populations (S4.3-9 — S4.3-13) .T h e ya r ep r o v i d e da sa guide but should be interpre t e dw i t hc a u t i o n .H i g h e r d a y t i m eS B Pm e a s u r e m e n t sf r o mA B P Mc a nb ea s s o c i a t e d with an increased risk of CVD and all-cause death inde- pendent of clinic-measured BP (S4.3-14) . A meta-analysis of observational studies that included 13,844 individuals suggested nighttime BP is a stronger risk factor for CHD and stroke than either clinic or daytime BP(S4.3-15) . Methodological issues complicate the interpretation of data from studies that report of ﬁce and out-of-of ﬁce BP readings. De ﬁnitions and diagnostic methods for identifying white coat hypertension and masked hyper- tension (see Section 4.4 ) have not been standardized. The available studies have differed with regard to number of of ﬁce readings obtained, use of 24-hour ABPM, use of daytime-only ABPM, inclusion of daytime and nighttime BP readings as separate categories, HBPM for monitoring out-of-of ﬁce BP levels, and even the BP thresholds used to de ﬁne hypertension with ABPM or HBPM readings. In addition, there are few data that address reproducibility of these hypertension pro ﬁles over time, with several studies suggesting progression of white coat hypertension and especially of masked hypertension to sustained of ﬁce-measured hypertension (S4.3-16 — S4.3-22) . 4.4. Masked and White Coat Hypertension Recommendations for Masked and White Coat Hypertension References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 4, 5, and 6. COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS IIa B-NR 1. In adults with an untreated SBP greater than 130 mm Hg but less than 160 mm Hg or DBP greater than 80 mm Hg but less than 100 mm Hg, it is reasonable to screen for the presence of white coat hyper- tension by using either daytime ABPM or HBPM before diagnosis of hypertension (S4.4-1 — S4.4-8) . IIa C-LD 2. In adults with white coat hypertension, periodic monitoring with either ABPM or HBPM is reasonable to detect transition to sustained hypertension (S4.4-2,S4.4-5,S4.4-7) . IIa C- LD 3. In adults being treated for hypertension with ofﬁce BP readings not at goal and HBPM readings sug- gestive of a signiﬁcant white coat effect, conﬁrmation by ABPM can be useful(S4.4-9,S4.4-10) . IIa B-NR 4. In adults with untreated ofﬁce BPs that are consistently between 120 mm Hg and 129 mm Hg for SBP or between 75 mm Hg and 79 mm Hg for DBP, screening for masked hypertension with HBPM (or ABPM) is reasonable (S4.4-3,S4.4-4,S4.4-6,S4.4-8,S4.4-11) . IIb C-LD 5. In adults on multiple-drug therapies for hypertension and ofﬁce BPs within 10 mm Hg above goal, it may be reasonable to screen for white coat effect with HBPM (or ABPM)(S4.4-3,S4.4-7,S4.4-12) . IIb C-EO 6. It may be reasonable to screen for masked uncontrolled hypertension with HBPM in adults being treated for hypertension and ofﬁce readings at goal, in the presence of target organ damage or increased overall CVD risk. IIb C-EO 7. In adults being treated for hypertension with elevated HBPM readings suggestive of masked uncontrolled hypertension, con ﬁrmation of the diagnosis by ABPM might be reasonable before intensiﬁcation of antihypertensive drug treatment. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e143 Synopsis The availability of noninvasive BP monitoring tech- niques has resulted in differentiation of hypertension into several clinically useful categories that are based on the place of BP measurement ( Table 12) (S4.4-1,S4.4-13, S4.4-14) . These include masked hypertension and white coat hypertension, in addition to sustained hypertension. White coat hypertension is characterized by elevated of- ﬁce BP but normal readings when measured outside the ofﬁce with either ABPM or HBPM. In contrast, masked hypertension is characterized by ofﬁce readings suggest- ing normal BP but out-of-of ﬁce (ABPM/HBPM) readings that are consistently above normal(S4.4-15) .I ns u s t a i n e d hypertension, BP readings are elevated in both ofﬁce and out-of-of ﬁce settings. In patients treated for hypertension, both “white coat effect ” (higher of ﬁce BPs than out-of-of ﬁce BPs) and “masked uncontrolled hypertension ” (controlled of ﬁce BPs but uncontrolled BPs in out-of-of ﬁce settings) cate- gories have been reported (S4.4-5,S4.4 -15,S4.4-16) .T h e white coat effect (usually considered clinically signiﬁcant when of ﬁce SBP/DBPs are >20/10 mm Hg higher than home or ABPM SBP/DBPs) has been implicated in “pseudo-resistant hypertension ” (see Section 11.1 )a n d r e s u l t si na nu n d e r e s t i m a t i o no fo fﬁce BP control rates (S4.4-17,S4.4-18) . The prevalence of masked hypertension varies from 10% to 26% (mean 13%) in population-based surveys and from 14% to 30% in normotensive clinic populations (S4.4-6,S4.4-16,S4.4-19 — S4.4-21) . The risk of CVD and all-cause mortality in persons with masked hypertension is similar to that noted in those with sustained hypertension and about twice as high as the corresponding risk in their normotensive counterparts (S4.4-3,S4.4-4,S4.4- 6,S4.4-8,S4.4-11) . The prevalence of masked hypertension increases with higher of ﬁce BP readings (S4.4-20,S4.4-22,S4.4-23) . The prevalence of white coat hypertension is higher with increasing age (S4.4-24) , female versus male sex, nonsmoking versus current smoking status, and routine ofﬁce measurement of BP by clinician observers versus unattended BP measurements. Many, but not all, studies (S4.4-4,S4.4-6,S4.4- 8,S4.4-25,S4.4-26) have identi ﬁed a minimal increase in risk of CVD complications or all-cause mortality in patients who have white coat hypertension. T h i sh a sr e s u l t e di nar e c o m m e n d a t i o nb ys o m ep a n e l st o screen for white coat hypertension with ABPM (or HBPM) to avoid initiating antihyp ertensive drug treatment in such individuals (S4.4-2,S4.4-5,S4.4-27) .T h ew h i t ec o a t effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension appear to follow the risk proﬁles of their white coat hypertension and masked hypertension counterparts, respectively (S4.4-3,S4.4-12) . There are no data on the risks and beneﬁts of treating white coat and masked hypertension. Despite these methodological differences, the data are consistent in indicating that masked hypertension and masked un- controlled hypertension are associated with an increased prevalence of target organ damage and risk of CVD, stroke, and mortality compared with normotensive in- dividuals and those with white coat hypertension.

White coat hypertension prevalence averages approx- imately 13% and as high as 35% in some hypertensive populations (S4.4-1,S4.4-2) ,a n dA B P Ma n dH B P Ma r e better predictors of CVD risk due to elevated BP than are of ﬁce BP measurements, with ABPM being the preferred measurement option. The major clinical relevance of white coat hypertension is that it has typically been associated with a minimal to only slightly increased risk of CVD and all-cause mortality risk (S4.4-3,S4.4-4,S4.4-7,S4.4-11,S4.4-24) .I fA B P M resources are not readily available, HBPM provides a reasonable but less desirable alternative to screen for white coat hypertension, although the overlap with ABPM is only 60% to 70% for detection of white coat hypertension (S4.4-5,S4.4-9,S4.4-27 — S4.4-30) . 2.

The overlap between HBPM and both daytime and 24- hour ABPM in diagnosing white coat hypertension is only 60% to 70%, and the data for prediction of CVD risk are stronger with ABPM than with of ﬁce mea- surements (S4.4-5,S4.4-9,S4.4-27 — S4.4-30) .B e c a u s ea diagnosis of white coat hypertension may result in a decision not to treat or intensify treatment in patients FIGURE 2 D e t e c t i o no fW h i t eC o a tE f f e c to rM a s k e dU n c o n t r o l l e dH y p e r t e n s i o ni nP a t i e n t so nD r u gT h e r a p y Colors correspond to Class of Recommendation inTable 1.

JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e145 with elevated of ﬁce BP readings, con ﬁrmation of BP control by ABPM in addition to HBPM provides added support for this decision. 4. In contrast to white coat hypertension, masked hy- pertension is associated with a CVD and all-cause mortality risk twice as high as that seen in normoten- sive individuals, with a risk range similar to that of patients with sustained hypertension (S4.4-3,S4.4-4, S4.4-6,S4.4-8,S4.4-11,S4.4-31) . Therefore, out-of- ofﬁce readings are reasonable to con ﬁrm BP control seen with ofﬁce readings. 5. The white coat effect has been implicated in of ﬁce- measured uncontrolled hypertension and pseudo- resistant hypertension, which may result in BP control being underestimated when subsequently assessed by ABPM (S4.4-17,S4.4-18) .T h er i s ko f vascular complications in patients with of ﬁce- measured uncontrolled hypertension with a white coat effect is similar to the risk in those with controlled hypertension (S4.4-3,S4.4-4,S4.4- 7,S4.4-11,S4.4-12) . White coat hypertension and white coat effect raise the concern that unnecessary antihypertensive drug ther- apy may be initiated or intensiﬁed. Because a diagnosis of white coat hypertension or white coat effect would result in a decision to not treat elevated of ﬁce BP readings, con ﬁrmation of BP control by HBPM (or ABPM) provides more deﬁnitive support for the deci- sion not to initiate antihypertensive drug therapy or accelerate treatment. 6. Analogous to masked hypertension in untreated pa- tients, masked uncontrolled hypertension is deﬁned in treated patients with hypertension by of ﬁce readings suggesting adequate BP control but out-of-of ﬁce readings (HBPM) that remain consistently above goal (S4.4-3,S4.4-15,S4.4 -16,S4.4-32,S4.4-33) .T h eC V Dr i s k proﬁle for masked uncontrolled hypertension appears to follow the risk pro ﬁle for masked hypertension (S4.4-3,S4.4-12,S4.4-34) . Although the evidence is consistent in identifying the increased risk of masked uncontrolled hypertension, evidence is lacking on whether the treatment of masked hypertension or masked uncontrolled hypertension reduces clinical outcomes. A suggestion for assessing CVD risk is pro- vided in Section 8. 7. Although both ABPM and HBPM are better predictors of CVD risk than are ofﬁce BP readings, ABPM conﬁrma- tion of elevated BP by HB PM might be reasonable because of the more extensive documentation of CVD r i s kw i t hA B P M .H o w e v e r ,u n l i k et h ed o c u m e n t a t i o no f as i g n iﬁcant white coat effect to justify the decision to not treat an elevated clinic BP, it is not mandatory to conﬁrm masked uncontrolled hypertension deter- mined by HBPM. 5. CAUSES OF HYPERTENSION 5.1. Genetic Predisposition Hypertension is a complex polygenic disorder in which many genes or gene combinations in ﬂuence BP (S5.1-1,S5.1-2) . Although several monogenic forms of hy- pertension have been identi ﬁed, such as glucocorticoid- remediable aldosteronism, Liddle ’s syndrome, Gordon ’s syndrome, and others in which single-gene mutations fully explain the pathophysiology of hypertension, these disorders are rare (S5.1-3) . The current tabulation of known genetic variants contributing to BP and hyper- tension includes more than 25 rare mutations and 120 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (S5.1-3,S5.1-4) .H o w - ever, even with the discovery of multiple single- nucleotide polymorphisms in ﬂuencing control of BP since completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, the associated variants have only small effects. Indeed, at present, the collective effect of all BP loci identi ﬁed through genome-wide association studies accounts for only about 3.5% of BP variability(S5.1-4) . The presence of a high number of small-effect alleles associated with higher BP results in a more rapid increase in BP with age (S5.1-5) . Future studies will need to better elucidate genetic expression, epigenetic effects, transcriptomics, and proteomics that link genotypes with underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. 5.2. Environmental Risk Factors Various environmental exposures, including components of diet, physical activity, and alcohol consumption, in- ﬂuence BP. Many dietary components have been associ- ated with high BP(S5.2-1,S5.2-2) . Some of the diet-related factors associated with high BP include overweight and obesity, excess intake of sodium, and insufﬁcient intake of potassium, calcium, magnesium, protein (especially from vegetables), ﬁber, and ﬁsh fats. Poor diet, physical inactivity, and excess intake of alcohol, alone or in com- bination, are the underlying cause of a large proportion of hypertension. Gut microbiota have also been linked to hypertension, especially in experimental animals (S5.2-3) . Some of the best-proven environmental relationships with high BP are brie ﬂy reviewed below, and non- pharmacological interventions to lower BP are discussed in Section 6.2. 5.2.1. Overweight and Obesity Insurance industry actuarial reports have identi ﬁed a striking relationship between body weight and high BP (S5.2.1-1) and a direct relationship between overweight/ obesity and hypertension (S5.2.1-2) . Epidemiological studies, including the Framingham Heart Study (S5.2.1-3) and the Nurses’Health Study (S5.2.1-4) , have consistently Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e146 identi ﬁed a direct relationship between body mass index and BP that is continuous and almost linear, with no ev- idence of a threshold (S5.2.1-5,S5.2.1-6) . The relationship with BP is even stronger for waist-to-hip ratio and computed tomographic measures of central fat distribu- tion (S5.2.1-7) . Attributable risk estimates from the Nurses ’ Health Study suggest that obesity may be responsible for about 40% of hypertension, and in the Framingham Offspring St udy, the corresponding es- timates were even higher (78% in men and 65% in women) (S5.2.1-8,S5.2.1-9) . The relationship between obesity at a young age and change in obesity status over time is strongly related to future risk of hypertension. In combined data from 4 longitudinal studies begun in adolescence with repeat examination in young adulthood to early middle age, being obese continuously or acquiring obesity was associated with a relative risk of 2.7 for developing hypertension. Becoming normal weight reduced the risk of developing hypertension to a level similar to those who had never been obese(S5.2.1-10) . 5.2.2. Sodium Intake Sodium intake is positively associated with BP in migrant (S5.2.2-11) ,c r o s s - s e c t i o n a l(S5.2.2-12 — S5.2.2-14) ,a n dp r o - spective cohort studies (S5.2.2-15) and accounts for much of the age-related increase in BP (S5.2.2-11,S5.2.2-16) .I n addition to the well-accepted and important relationship of dietary sodium with BP, excessive consumption of so- dium is independently associat e dw i t ha ni n c r e a s e dr i s ko f stroke (S5.2.2-17,S5.2.2-18) ,C V D (S5.2.2-19) ,a n do t h e r adverse outcomes (S5.2.2-20) . Certain groups with various demographic, physiological, and genetic characteristics tend to be particularly sensitive to the effects of dietary sodium on BP (S5.2.2-21 — S5.2.2-23) .S a l ts e n s i t i v i t yi sa quantitative trait in which an increase in sodium load disproportionately increases BP (S5.2.2-21,S5.2.2-24) .S a l t sensitivity is especially common in blacks, older adults, and those with a higher level of BP or comorbidities such as CKD, DM, or the metabolic syndrome (S5.2.2-25) .I n aggregate, these groups constitute more than half of all U.S. adults (S5.2.2-26) . Salt sensitivity may be a marker for increased CVD and all-cause mortality risk independently of BP (S5.2.2-27,S5.2.2-28) , and the trait has been demon- strated to be reproducible (S5.2.2-29) . Current techniques for recognition of salt sensitivity are impractical in routine clinical practice, so salt sensitivity is best considered as a group characteristic. 5.2.3. Potassium Potassium intake is inversely related to BP in migrant (S5.2.3-30) ,c r o s s - s e c t i o n a l(S5.2.2-13,S5.2.2-16,S5.2.3-31, S5.2.3-32) , and prospective cohort(S5.2.3-33) studies. It is also inversely related to stroke (S5.2.3-34 — S5.2.3-36) . A higher level of potassium seems to blunt the effect of sodium on BP(S5.2.3-37) , with a lower sodium–potassium ratio being associated with a lower level of BP than that noted for corresponding levels of sodium or potassium on their own (S5.2.3-38) . Likewise, epidemiological studies suggest that a lower sodium–potassium ratio may result in a reduced risk of CVD as compared with the pattern for corresponding levels of either cation on its own(S5.2.3-39) . 5.2.4. Physical Fitness Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between physical activity and physical ﬁtness and level of BP and hypertension(S5.2.4-40) .E v e n modest levels of physical activity have been associated with a decrease in the risk of incident hypertension (S5.2.4-41) . In several observational studies, the rela- tionship between physical activity and BP has been most apparent in white men (S5.2.4-40) .W i t ht h ea d v e n to f electronic activity trackers and ABPM, it has become increasingly feasible to conduct studies that relate phys- ical activity and BP(S5.2.4-42) .P h y s i c a lﬁtness, measured objectively by graded exercise testing, attenuates the rise of BP with age and prevents the development of hyper- tension. In the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Develop- ment in Young Adults) study (S5.2.4-43) ,p h y s i c a lﬁtness measured at 18 to 30 years of age in the upper 2 deciles of an otherwise healthy population was associated with one third the risk of developing hypertension 15 years later, and one half the risk after adjustment for body mass in- dex, as compared with the lowest quintile.

Alcohol The presence of a direct relationship between alcohol consumption and BP wasﬁrst reported in 1915(S5.2.5-45) and has been repeatedly identiﬁed in contemporary cross- sectional and prospective cohort studies (S5.2.5-46) .E s - timates of the contribution of alcohol consumption to population incidence and prevalence of hypertension vary according to level of intake. In the United States, it seems likely that alcohol may account for close to 10% of t h ep o p u l a t i o nb u r d e no fh y p e r t e n s i o n( h i g h e ri nm e n than in women). In contrast to its detrimental effect on BP, alcohol intake is associated with a higher level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and, within modest ranges of intake, a lower levelof CHD than that associated with abstinence (S5.2.3-35) . 5.3. Childhood Risk Factors and BP Tracking BP distribution in the general population increases with age. Multiple longitudinal studies have investigated the JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e147 relationship of childhood BP to adult BP. A meta- analysis of 50 such studies showed correlation co- efﬁcients of about 0.38 for SBP and 0.28 for DBP, with BPs in the upper range of the pediatric distribution (particularly BPs obtained in adolescence) predicting hypertension in adulthood (S5.3-1) .S e v e r a lf a c t o r s , including genetic factors and development of obesity, increase the likelihood that a high childhood BP will lead to future hypertension (S5.3-2) . Premature birth is associated with a 4–mm Hg higher SBP and a 3–mm Hg higher DBP in adulthood, with somewhat larger effects i nw o m e nt h a ni nm e n(S5.3-3) . Low birth weight from other causes also contributes to higher BP in later life (S5.3-4) . 5.4. Secondary Forms of Hypertension Recommendations for Secondary Forms of Hypertension COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS I C-EO 1. Screening for speciﬁc form(s) of secondary hypertension is recommended when the clinical indications and physical examination ﬁndings listed in Table 13 are present or in adults with resistant hypertension. IIb C-EO 2. If an adult with sustained hypertension screens positive for a form of secondary hypertension, referral to a physician with expertise in that form of hypertension may be reasonable for diagnostic conﬁrmation and treatment. Synopsis As p e c iﬁc, remediable cause of hypertension can be identi ﬁed in approximately 10% of adult patients with hypertension (S5.4-1) . If a cause can be correctly diag- nosed and treated, patients with secondary hypertension can achieve a cure or experience a marked improvement in BP control, with reduction in CVD risk. All new patients with hypertension should be screened with a history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations, as recommended in Section 7, before initiation of treatment. Secondary hypertension can underlie severe elevation of BP, pharmacologically resistant hypertension, sudden onset of hypertension, increased BP in patients with hy- pertension previously contro lled on drug therapy, onset of diastolic hypertension in ol der adults, and target organ damage disproportionate to the duration or severity of the hypertension. Although secondary hypertension should be suspected in younger patients (<30 years of age) with elevated BP, it is not uncommon for primary hypertension to manifest at a younger age, especially in blacks(S5.4-2) , and some forms of secondary hypertension, such as renovascular disease, are more common at older age. Many of the causes of secondary hypertension are strongly associated with clinical ﬁndings or groups ofﬁndings that suggest a speciﬁcd i s o r d e r .

Drugs and Other Substances With Potential to Impair BP Control Numerous substances, including prescription medica- tions, over-the-counter medi cations, herbals, and food substances, may affect BP ( Table 14) (S5.4.1-1 — S5.4.1-6) . Changes in BP that occur because of drugs and other agents have been associated with the development of hyperten- sion, worsening control in a patient who already has hypertension, or attenuation of the BP-lowering effects of antihypertensive therapy. A change in BP may also result from drug –drug or drug –food interactions (S5.4.1-2, S5.4.1-4) . In the clinical assessment of hypertension, a careful history should be taken with regard to substances that may impair BP control, with close attention paid to not only prescription medications, but also over-the-counter sub- stances, illicit drugs, and herbal products. When feasible, drugs associated with increased BP should be reduced or discontinued, and alternative agents should be used.

Primary Aldosteronism Synopsis Primary aldosteronism is de ﬁned as a group of disor- ders in which aldosterone production is inappropriately high for sodium status, is relatively autonomous of the major regulators of secretion (angiotensin II and potas- sium), and cannot be suppressed with sodium loading (S5.4.2-2,S5.4.2-3) . The increased production of aldoste- rone induces hypertension; cardiovascular and kidney damage; sodium retention; suppressed plasma renin ac- tivity; and increased potassium excretion, which, if pro- longed and severe, may cause hypokalemia. However, hypokalemia is absent in the majority of cases and has a low negative predictive value for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism (S5.4.2-4) . In about 50% of the patients, primary aldosteronism is due to increased unilateral aldosterone production (usually aldosterone-producing adenoma or, rarely, unilatera l adrenal hyperplasia); in the remaining 50%, primary aldosteronism is due to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (idiopathic hyper- aldosteronism) (S5.4.2-2,S5.4.2-3) . Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Primary aldosteronism is one of the most frequent disorders (occurring in 5% to 10% of patients with hypertension and 20% of patients with resistant hypertension) that cause s secondary hypertension (S5.4.2-5,S5.4.2-6) . The toxic tissue effects of aldoste- rone induce greater target organ damage in primary aldosteronism than in primary hypertension. Patients with primary aldosteronism have a 3.7-fold increase in HF, a 4.2-fold increase in stroke, a 6.5-fold increase in MI, a 12.1-fold increase in atrial ﬁbrillation (AF), increased left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and dia- stolic dysfunction, increased stiffness of large arteries, widespread tissue ﬁbrosis, increased remodeling of resistance vessels, and increased kidney damage as compared with patients with primary hypertension matched for BP level (S5.4.2-6 — S5.4.2-8) .B e c a u s et h e deleterious effects of aldosterone overproduction are often reversible with unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy or treatment with mineralocorticoid TABLE 14 Continued Agent Possible Management Strategy NSAIDs n Avoid systemic NSAIDs when possible n Consider alternative analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, tramadol, topical NSAIDs), depending on indication and risk Recreational drugs (e.g.,“bath salts” [MDPV], cocaine, methamphetamine, etc.) n Discontinue or avoid use Systemic corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone,ﬂudrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisone, prednisolone) n Avoid or limit use when possible n Consider alternative modes of administrati on (e.g., inhaled, topical) when feasible Angiogenesis inhibitor (e.g., bevacizumab) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., sunitinib, sorafenib) n Initiate or intensify antihypertensive therapy *List is not all inclusive.

Recommendations for Primary Aldosteronism COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS I C-EO 1. In adults with hypertension, screening for primary aldosteronism is recommended in the presence of any of the following concurrent conditions: resistant hypertension, hypokal emia (spontaneous or substantial, if diuretic induced), incidentally discovered adrena l mass, family history of early-onset hypertension, or stroke at a young age (<40 years). I C-LD 2. Use of the plasma aldosterone: renin activity ratio is recommended when adults are screened for primary aldosteronism (S5.4.2-1) . I C-EO 3. In adults with hypertension and a positive screening test for primary aldosteronism, referral to a hypertension specialist or endocr inologist is recommended for further evaluation and treatment. Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e152 receptor antagonists (i.e., spironolactone or epler- enone), screening of patients with hypertension at increased risk of primary aldosteronism is bene ﬁcial (S5.4.2-2,S5.4.2-3) . These include hypertensive patients with adrenal “incidentaloma, ” an incidentally discovered adrenal lesion on a computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan performed for other purposes. Patients with hypertension and a history of early onset hypertension and/or cerebro- vascular accident at a young age may have primary aldosteronism due to glucocorticoid-remediable aldo- steronism (familial hyperal dosteronism type-1) and therefore warrant screening (S5.4.2-2,S5.4.2-3) . 2. The aldosterone:renin activity ratio is currently the most accurate and reliable means of screening for primary aldosteronism (S5.4.2-1) . The most commonly used cutoff value is 30 when plasma aldosterone concentration is reported in nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL) and plasma renin a ctivity in nanograms per milliliter per hour (ng/mL/h) (S5.4.2-3) .B e c a u s et h e aldosterone:renin activity ratio can be in ﬂuenced by the presence of very low renin levels, the plasma aldosterone concentration should be at least 10 ng/dL to interpret the test as positive(S5.4.2-3) . Patients should have unrestricted salt intake, serum potassium in the normal range, and mineraloc orticoid receptor antago- nists (e.g., spironolactone or eplerenone) withdrawn for at least 4 weeks before testing(S5.4.2-2,S5.4.2-3) . 3. The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism generally re- quires a conﬁrmatory test (intravenous saline suppres- sion test or oral salt-loading test)(S5.4.2-2,S5.4.2-3) .I f the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism is con ﬁrmed (and the patient agrees that surgery would be desirable), the patient is referred for an adrenal venous sampling procedure to determine wh ether the increased aldo- sterone production is unilateral or bilateral in origin. If unilateral aldosterone production is documented on adrenal venous sampling, the patient is referred for unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy, which improves BP in virtually 100% of patients and results in a complete cure of hypertension in about 50%(S5.4.2-2, S5.4.2-3) . If the patient has bilaterally increased aldo- sterone secretion on adrenal venous sampling or has a unilateral source of excess aldosterone production b u tc a n n o tu n d e r g os u r g e r y ,t h ep a t i e n ti st r e a t e d with spironolactone or eplerenone as agent of choice (S5.4.2-2,S5.4.2-3) . Both adrenalectomy and medical ktherapy are effective in lowering BP and reversing LVH. Treating primary aldosteronism, either by miner- alocorticoid receptor antagonists or unilateral adrenal- ectomy (if indicated), resolves hypokalemia, lowers BP, reduces the number of antih ypertensive medications required, and improves parameters of impaired cardiac and kidney function (S5.4.2-9,S5.4.2-10) . 5.4.3. Renal Artery Stenosis Recommendations for Renal Artery Stenosis References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 7 and 24. COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS IA 1. Medical therapy is recommended for adults with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (S5.4.3-1,S5.4.3-2) . IIb C-EO 2. In adults with renal artery stenosis for whom medical management has failed (refractory hypertension, worsening renal function, and/or intractable HF) an d those with nonatheroscler otic disease, including ﬁbromuscular dysplasia, it may be reasonable to refer the patient for consideration of revascularization (percutaneous renal artery angiop lasty and/or stent placement). Synopsis Renal artery stenosis refers to a narrowing of the renal artery that can result in a restriction of blood ﬂow. Atherosclerotic disease (9 0%) is by far the most common cause of renal artery stenosis, whereas nonatherosclerotic disease (of which ﬁbromuscular dysplasia is the most common) is much less prevalent and tends to occur in younger, healthier patients (S5.4.3-3) . Renal artery ste- nosis is a common form of secondary hypertension. Relieving ischemia and the ensuing postischemic release of renin by surgical renal artery reconstruction is an invasive strategy with a postoperative mortality as high as 13% (S5.4.3-4) . With the advent of endovascular proced- ures to restore blood ﬂow, several trials were designed to test the ef ﬁcacy of these procedures against medical therapy, but they suggested no bene ﬁto v e rm e d i c a l therapy alone (S5.4.3-1,S5.4.3-2) . Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. Atherosclerotic disease in the renal arteries represents systemic disease and higher risk of both renal failure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. No RCT to JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e153 date has demonstrated a clinical advantage of renal artery revascularization (with either angioplasty or stenting) over medical therapy (S5.4.3-2) .O nt h eb a s i s of the CORAL (Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions) t rial, the recommended med- ical approach encompasses optimal management of hypertension with an antihy pertensive regimen that includes a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker, in addition to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduc- tion with a high-intensity statin, smoking cessation, hemoglobin A1c reduction in patients with DM, and antiplatelet therapy (S5.4.3-1) . 2. Revascularization may be considered for those who do not respond to medical therapy and for those who have nonatherosclerotic disease (e.g., Takayasu arteritis in Asian populations, ﬁbromuscular dysplasia in other populations). Fibromuscular dysplasia occurs over the lifespan of women (mean: 53 years of age) with almost equal frequency in the renal and carotid circulations (S5.4.3-3) . Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty alone (without stenting) can improve BP control and even normalize BP, especially in patients with recent onset of hypertension or resistant hypertension (S5.4.3-5) . Recommendation for Obstructive Sleep Apnea References that support the recommendation are summarized in Online Data Supplement 8 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION IIb B-R 1. In adults with hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea, the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to reduce BP is not well established(S5.4.4-1 — S5.4.4-5) . 5.4.4. Obstructive Sleep Apnea Synopsis Obstructive sleep apnea is a common chronic condition characterized by recurrent collapse of upper airways dur- ing sleep, inducing intermittent episodes of apnea/hypo- pnea, hypoxemia, and sleep disruption (S5.4.4-6) . Obstructive sleep apnea is a risk factor for several CVDs, including hypertension, coronary and cerebrovascular diseases, HF, and AF (S5.4.4-6 — S5.4.4-9) . Observational s t u d i e sh a v es h o w nt h a tt h ep r e s e n c eo fo b s t r u c t i v es l e e p apnea is associated with increased risk of incident hy- pertension (S5.4.4-10,S5.4.4-11) . Obstructive sleep apnea is highly prevalent in adults with resistant hypertension ($80%) (S5.4.4-12,S5.4.4-13) , and it has been hypothe- sized that treatment with CPAP may have more pro- nounced effects on BP reduction in resistant hypertension (S5.4.4-6) . Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. CPAP is an ef ﬁcacious treatment for improving obstructive sleep apnea. However, studies of the effects of CPAP on BP have demonstrated only small effects on BP (e.g., 2 – to 3 –mm Hg reductions), with results dependent on patient compliance with CPAP use, severity of obstructive sleep apnea, and presence of daytime sleepiness in study participants (S5.4.4-1 — S5.4.4-5) . Although many RCTs have been reported that address the effects of CPAP on BP in obstructive sleep apnea, most of the patients studied did not have documented hypertension , and the studies were too small and the follow-up period too short to allow for adequate evaluation. In addition, a well-designed RCT demonstrated that CPAP plus usual care, compared with usual care alone, did not prevent cardiovascular events in patients with moderate–severe obstructive sleep ap- nea and established CVD (S5.4.4-14) . 6. NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS Correcting the dietary aberrations, physical inactivity, and excessive consumption of alcohol that cause high BP is a fundamentally important approach to prevention and management of high BP, either on their own or in combi- nation with pharmacological therapy. Prevention of hy- pertension and treatment of established hypertension are complementary approaches to reducing CVD risk in the population, but prevention of hypertension provides the optimal means of reducing risk and avoiding the harmful consequences of hypertension (S6-1 — S6-3) .N o n - pharmacological therapy alone is especially useful for prevention of hypertension, including in adults with elevated BP, and for management of high BP in adults with milder forms of hypertension (S6-4,S6-5) . 6.1. Strategies Nonpharmacological interventions can be accomplished by means of behavioral strategies aimed at lifestyle change, prescription of dietary supplements, or imple- mentation of kitchen-based in terventions that directly modify elements of the diet. At a societal level, policy changes can enhance the availability of healthy foods and Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e154 facilitate physical activity. The goal can be to modestly reduce BP in the general population or to undertake more intensive targeted lowering of BP in adults with hypertension or at high risk of developing hypertension (S6.1-1) . The intent of the general population approach is to achieve a small downward shift in the general population distribution of BP, which would be expected to result in substantial health bene ﬁts (S6.1-2) .T h e targeted approach focuses o n BP reduction in adults at greatest risk of developing BP-related CVD, including individuals with hypertension, as well as those at increased risk of developing hypertension, especially blacks and adults who are overweight, consume excessive amounts of dietary sodium, have a high intake of alcohol, or are physically inactive. The targeted approach tends to be intensive, with a more ambitious goal for BP reduction. Both approaches are complementary and mutually reinforcing, and modeling studies suggest they are likely to provide similar public health bene ﬁt (S6.1-3,S6.1-4) . However, as the precision of risk prediction tools increases, targeted prevention strategies that focus on high-risk individuals seem to become more efﬁcient than population-based strategies (S6.1-5) . 6.2. Nonpharmacological Interventions Recommendations for Nonpharmacological Interventions References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 9-21 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS IA 1. Weight loss is recommended to reduce BP in adults with elevated BP or hypertension who are overweight or obese (S6.2-1 — S6.2-4) . IA 2. A heart-healthy diet, such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, that facilitates achieving a desirable weight is recomme nded for adults with elevated BP or hypertension (S6.2-5 — S6.2-7) . IA 3. Sodium reduction is recommended for adults with elevated BP or hypertension (S6.2-8 — S6.2-12) . IA 4. Potassium supplementation , preferably in dietary modiﬁcation, is recommended for adults with elevated BP or hypertension, unless contraindicated by the presence of CKD or use of drugs that reduce potassium excretion (S6.2-13 — S6.2-17) . IA 5. Increased physical activity with a structured exercise program is recommended for adults with elevated BP or hypertension (S6.2-3,S6.2-4,S6.2-12,S6.2-18 — S6.2-22) . IA 6. Adult men and women with elevated BP or hypertension who currently consume alcohol should be advised to drink no more than 2 and 1 standard drinks* per day, respectively (S6.2-23 — S6.2-28) . *In the United States, 1“standard” drink contains roughly 14 g of pure alcohol, which is typically found in 12 oz of regular beer (usually about 5% alcohol), 5 oz of wine (usually about 12% alcohol), and 1.5 oz of distilled spirits (usually about 40% alcohol)(S6.2-29). Synopsis Nonpharmacological interv entions are effective in lowering BP, with the most important interventions being weight loss (S6.2-1) , the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet (S6.2-5 — S6.2-7,S6.2-30) ,s o d i u m reduction (S6.2-8 — S6.2-12) , potassium supplementation (S6.2-13,S6.2-17) , increased physical activity (S6.2-18 — S6.2-22,S6.2-31) , and a reduction in alcohol consumption (S6.2-23,S6.2-24) . Various other nonpharmacological in- terventions have been reported to lower BP, but the extent and/or quality of the supporting clinical trial experience is less persuasive. Such interventions include consumption of probiotics (S6.2-32,S6.2-33,S6.2-34) ;i n c r e a s e di n t a k eo f protein (S6.2-35 — S6.2-37) , ﬁber (S6.2-38,S6.2-39) , ﬂaxseed (S6.2-40) ,o r ﬁsh oil (S6.2-41) ; supplementation with cal- cium (S6.2-42,S6.2-43) or magnesium (S6.2-44,S6.2-45) ; and use of dietary patterns other than the DASH diet, including low-carbohydrate, vegetarian, and Mediterra- nean diets (S6.2-46 — S6.2-49) . Stress reduction is intui- tively attractive but insufﬁciently proved (S6.2-51) ,a sa r e several other interventions, including consumption of garlic (S6.2-52) ,d a r kc h o c o l a t e(S6.2-53,S6.2-54) ,t e a(S6.2- 55), or coffee (S6.2-56) . Behavioral therapies, including guided breathing, yo ga, transcendental meditation, and biofeedback, lack strong evidence for their long-term BP- lowering effect (S6.2-51,S6.2-57 — S6.2-61) . The best proven JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e155 nonpharmacological measures to prevent and treat hy- pertension are summarized in Table 15 (S6.2-62) . The nonpharmacological interventions presented in Table 15 may be sufﬁcient to prevent hypertension and meet goal BP in managing patients with stage 1 hyper- tension, and they are an integral part of the management of persons with stage 2 hypertension. To a lesser extent, the Mediterranean diet (S6.2-49,S6.2-63) (which in- corporates the basics of healthy eating but emphasizes consumption of legumes and monounsaturated fat, avoidance of red meats, and moderate intake of wine) has been effective in reducing BP, as well as improving lipid proﬁle. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Weight loss is a core recommendation and should be achieved through a combination of reduced calorie intake and increased physical activity (S6.2-1) .T h e BP-lowering effect of weight loss in patients with elevated BP is consistent with the corresponding effect in patients with established hypertension, with an apparent dose–response relationship of about 1 mm Hg per kilogram of weight loss. Achievement and maintenance of weight loss through behavior change are challenging (S6.2-64 — S6.2-66) but feasible over prolonged periods of follow-up (S6.2-64) .F o rt h o s e who do not meet their weight loss goals with non- pharmacological interventions, pharmacotherapy or minimally invasive and bari atric surgical procedures can be considered (S6.2-67,S6.2-68) .S u r g i c a lp r o c e d - ures tend to be more effective but are usually reserved for those with more severe and intractable obesity because of the frequency of complications (S6.2-69) . 2. The DASH eating plan is the diet best demonstrated to be effective for lowering BP. Because the DASH diet is high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, it provides a means to enhance intake of potassium, calcium, magnesium, and ﬁber. In hypertensive and nonhypertensive adults, the DASH diet has produced overall reductions in SBP of approximately 11 mm Hg and 3 mm Hg, respectively (S6.2-7) ,a n dt h ed i e tw a s especially effective in blacks (S6.2-70) .W h e nc o m - b i n e dw i t hw e i g h tl o s s(S6.2-6) or a reduction in so- dium intake (S6.2-5,S6.2-30) , the effect size was substantially increased.

DASH indicates Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension; and SBP, systolic blood pressure. Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e156 (S6.2-7) , but lifestyle change with the DASH diet has been successful in at least 2 trials that used a behav- ioral intervention over a 4-month(S6.2-30) or 6-month (S6.2-6) period of follow-up. Websites and books pro- vide advice on implementation of the DASH diet(S6.2- 13,S6.2-71 — S6.2-74) . Counseling by a knowledgeable nutritionist can be helpful. Several other diets, including diets that are low in calories from carbohy- drates (S6.2-46) ,h i g h - p r o t e i nd i e t s(S6.2-75) , vege- tarian diets (S6.2-48) , and a Mediterranean dietary pattern (S6.2-49,S6.2-63) , have been shown to lower BP. 3. Sodium reduction interventions prevent hypertension and lower BP in adults with hypertension, especially in those with higher levels of BP, blacks, older persons, and others who are particularly susceptible to the ef- fects of sodium on BP (S6.2-8 — S6.2-11) .S o d i u m reduction interventions may prevent CVD (S6.2- 76,S6.2-77) . Lifestyle change (behavioral) in- terventions usually reduce sodium intake by about 25% (approximately 1,000 mg per day) and result in an average of about a 2–mm Hg to 3–mm Hg reduction in SBP in nonhypertensive individuals, though the reduction can be more than double this in more sus- ceptible individuals, those with hypertension, and those concurrently on the DASH diet (S6.2-5) or receiving a weight loss intervention (S6.2-12) .S o d i u m reduction in adults with hypertension who are already being treated with BP-lower ing medications further reduces SBP by about 3 mm Hg and can facilitate discontinuation of medication, although this requires maintenance of the lifestyle change and warrants careful monitoring (S6.2-12) .W h e nc o m b i n e dw i t h weight loss, the reduction in BP is almost doubled. A reduction in sodium intake may also lower SBP signi ﬁcantly in individuals with resistant hypertension who are taking multiple antihypertensive medications (S6.2-78) (see Section 11.1 ). Reduced dietary sodium has been reported to augment the BP-lowering effects of RAS blocker therapy (S6.2-79) . Maintenance of the lifestyle changes necessary to reduce sodium intake is challenging (S6.2-2 — S6.2-4,S6.2-12) ,b u te v e nas m a l l decrement in sodium consumption is likely to be safe (S6.2-2,S6.2-4,S6.2-9,S6.2-12,S6.2-80) and bene ﬁcial (S6.2-8,S6.2-81) , especially in those whose BP is salt sensitive (S6.2-82) . In the United States, most dietary sodium comes from additions during food processing or during commercial food preparation at sit-down and fast-food restaurants (S6.2-83,S6.2-84) . Person-speciﬁc and policy approaches can be used to reduce dietary sodium intake (S6.2-85,S6.2-86) . Individuals can take action to reduce their dietary intake of sodium by choice of fresh foods, use of food labels to choose foods that are lower in sodium content, choice of foods with a “no added sodium ” label, judicious use of condi- ments and sodium-infused foods, use of spices and low-sodium ﬂavorings, careful ordering when eating out, control of food portion size, and avoiding or minimizing use of salt at the table. Dietary counseling by a nutritionist with expertise in behavior modi ﬁca- tion can be helpful. A reduction in the amount of so- dium added during food processing, as well as fast food and restaurant food preparation, has the potential to substantially reduce sodium intake without the need for a conscious change in lifestyle (S6.2-81,S6.2- 85,S6.2-87) . 4. Dietary potassium is inversely related to BP and hy- pertension in migrant studies(S6.2-88) ,c r o s s - s e c t i o n a l reports (S6.2-89 — S6.2-91) , and prospective cohort studies (S6.2-92) . Likewise, dietary potassium (S6.2- 93— S6.2-96) and a high intake of fruits and vegetables a r ea s s o c i a t e dw i t hal o w e ri n c i d e n c eo fs t r o k e(S6.2- 97). Potassium interventions have been effective in lowering BP (S6.2-13,S6.2-14,S6.2-16,S6.2-81) ,e s p e - cially in adult patients consuming an excess of sodium (S6.2-13,S6.2-74,S6.2-98) and in blacks (S6.2-13) .T h e typical BP-lowering effect of a 60-mmol (1380-mg) administration of potassium chloride has been about 2 mm Hg and 4 to 5 mm Hg in adults with normo- tension and hypertension, respectively, although the response is up to twice as much in persons consuming a high-sodium diet. A reduction in the sodium/potas- sium index may be more important than the corre- sponding changes in either electrolyte alone (S6.2-99) . Some but not all studies suggest that the intervention effect may be restricted to adult patients with a low (1500-mg to 2000-mg) daily intake of potassium (S6.2-92,S6.2-100) . Most of the intervention experience comes from trials of relatively short duration (median o f5t o6w e e k s )(S6.2-13,S6.2-14) , but the BP-lowering effect of potassium in adult patients consuming a high-sodium diet has been reproduced after an interval of 4.4 years (S6.2-98) .I nm o s tt r i a l s ,p o t a s s i u ms u p - plementation was achieved by administration of po- tassium chloride pills, but the BP response pattern was similar when dietary modi ﬁcation was used (S6.2-13) . Because potassium-rich diets tend to be heart healthy, they are preferred over use of pills for potassium sup- plementation. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Ameri- cans (S6.2-101) encourage a diet rich in potassium and identify the adequate intake level for adult patients as 4700 mg/day (S6.2-102) .T h eW o r l dH e a l t hO r g a n i z a - tion recommends a potassium intake of at least 90 mmol (3510 mg) per day from food for adult patients (S6.2-15) . Good sources of dietary potassium include fruits and vegetables, as well as low-fat dairy products, selected ﬁs ha n dm e a t s ,n u t s ,a n ds o yp r o d u c t s .F o u r to ﬁve servings of fruits and vegetables will usually JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e157 provide 1500 to >3000 mg of potassium. This can be achieved by a diet, such as the DASH diet, that is high in potassium content (S6.2-7) . 5. A BP-lowering effect of increased physical activity has been repeatedly demonstrated in clinical trials, espe- cially during dynamic aerobic exercise (S6.2-18,S6.2- 20,S6.2-22) , but also during dynamic resistance training (S6.2-18,S6.2-21) and static isometric exercise (S6.2-18,S6.2-19,S6.2-31) . The average reductions in SBP with aerobic exercise are approximately 2 to 4 mm Hg and 5 to 8 mm Hg in adult patients with normotension and hypertension, respectively (S6.2- 18). Most trials have been of relatively short duration, but increased physical activity has been an intrinsic component of longer-term weight reduction in- terventions used to reduce BP and prevent hyperten- sion (S6.2-3,S6.2-4,S6.2-12) .B P - l o w e r i n ge f f e c t sh a v e been reported with lower- and higher-intensity exer- cise and with continuous and interval exercise training (S6.2-18,S6.2-103) . Meta-analyses suggest isometric exercise results in substantial lowering of BP (S6.2-18,S6.2-19,S6.2-31) . 6. In observational studies, there is a strong, predictable direct relationship between alcohol consumption and BP, especially above an intake of 3 standard drinks per day (approximately 36 ounces of regular beer, 15 oun- ces of wine, or 4.5 ounces of distilled spirits) (S6.2- 29,S6.2-104,S6.2-105) . Meta-analyses of RCTs that have studied the effect of reduced alcohol consump- tion on BP in adults have identi ﬁed a signi ﬁcant r e d u c t i o ni nS B Pa n dD B P(S6.2-23,S6.2-24) .T h eb e n eﬁt has seemed to be consistent across trials, but conﬁned to those consuming $3 drinks/day, as well as dose dependent, with those consuming $6d r i n k s / d a ya t baseline who reduce their alcohol intake by about 50%, experiencing an average reduction in SBP/DBP of approximately 5.5/4.0 mm Hg (S6.2-23,S6.2-24) .O n l y limited information is available on the effect of alcohol r e d u c t i o no nB Pi nb l a c k s(S6.2-23,S6.2-106) .I n contrast to its effect on BP, alcohol seems to have a beneﬁcial effect on several biomarkers for CVD risk, including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (S6.2- 107,S6.2-108) . Observational studies have shown a relatively consistent ﬁnding of an inverse relationship between alcohol intake and CHD (S6.2-109,S6.2-110) , within a moderate range (approximately 12–14 and #9 standard drinks/week for men and women, respec- tively). On balance, it seems reasonable for those who are consuming moderate quantities of alcohol ( #2 drinks/day) to continue their moderate consumption of alcohol. 7. PATIENT EVALUATION The patient evaluation is designed to identify target or- gan damage and possible secondary causes of hyper- tension and to assist in planning an effective treatment regimen. Historical features are relevant to the evalua- tion of the patient ( Table 16 ). The pattern of BP mea- s u r e m e n t sa n dc h a n g e so v e rt i m em a yd i f f e r e n t i a t e primary from secondary causes of hypertension. A rise in BP associated with weight gain, lifestyle factors (such as a job change requiring travel and meals away from home), reduced frequency or intensity of physical ac- tivity, or advancing age in a patient with a strong family history of hypertension wou ld suggest the diagnosis of primary hypertension. An evaluation of the patient ’s dietary habits, physical activity, alcohol consumption, a n dt o b a c c ou s es h o u l db ep e r f o r m e d ,w i t hr e c o m m e n - dation of the nonpharmacological interventions detailed in Section 6.2 where appropriate. The history should also include inquiry into possible occurrence of symptoms to indicate a secondary cause ( Tables 13 and 16 ). The pa- tient ’s treatment goals and risk tolerance should also be elicited. This is especially true for older persons, for whom an assessment of multiple chronic conditions, frailty, and prognosis should be performed, including consideration of the time required to see bene ﬁtf r o m intervention, which may not be realized for some individuals.

Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e158 The physical examination should include accurate measurement of BP ( Table 8 ). Automated oscillometric devices provide an opportunity to obtain repeated mea- surements without a provider present, thereby mini- mizing the potential for a white coat effect. Change in BP from seated to standing position should be measured to detect orthostatic hypotension (a decline >20 mm Hg in SBP or>10 mm Hg in DBP after 1 minute is abnormal). For adults #30 years of age with elevated brachial BP, a thigh BP measurement is indicated; if the thigh measurement is lower than arm pressures, a diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta should be considered. The physical examination should include assessment of hypertension-related target organ damage. Attention should be paid to physical fea- tures that suggest secondary hypertension (Table 13). 7.1. Laboratory Tests and Other Diagnostic Procedures Laboratory measurements should be obtained for all pa- tients with a new diagnosis of hypertension to facilitate CVD risk factor proﬁling, establish a baseline for medica- tion use, and screen for secondary causes of hypertension (Table 17 ). Optional tests may provide information on target organ damage. Monitoring of serum sodium and potassium levels is helpful during diuretic or RAS blocker titration, as are serum creatinine and urinary albumin as markers of CKD progression (S7.1-1) .M e a s u r e m e n to f thyroid-stimulating hormone is a simple test to easily detect hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, 2 remedi- able causes of hypertension. A decision to conduct addi- tional laboratory testing would be appropriate in the context of increased hypertension severity, poor response to standard treatment approa ches, a disproportionate severity of target organ damage for the level of BP, or historical or clinical clues that support a secondary cause. 7.2. Cardiovascular Target Organ Damage Pulse-wave velocity, carotid intima-media thickness, and coronary artery calcium score provide noninvasive estimates of vascular target organ injury and atheroscle- rosis (S7.2-1) . High BP readings, especially when obtained several years before a noninvasive measurement, are associated with an increase in subclinical CVD risk (S7.2-2 — S7.2-4) . Although carotid intima-media thickness values and coronary artery calcium scores are associated with cardiovascular events, i nadequate or absent infor- mation on the effect of improvement in these markers on cardiovascular events prev ents their routine use as surrogate markers in the treatment of hypertension. LVH is a secondary manifestation of hypertension and independently predicts future CVD events. LVH is commonly measured by electrocardiography, echocardi- ography, or MRI(S7.2-5,S7.2-6) .L e f tv e n t r i c u l a r( L V )m a s s is associated with body size (particularly lean body mass), tobacco use, heart rate (inverse), and long-standing DM (S7.2-7 — S7.2-9) . BP lowering leads to a reduction in LV mass. In TOMHS (Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study), the long-acting diuretic chlorthalidone was slightly more effective in reducing LVH than were a calcium channel blocker (CCB) (amlodipine), ACE inhibitor (enalapril), alpha-receptor blocker (doxazosin), or beta-receptor blocker (acebutolol) (S7.2-10) . Beta blockers are inferior to angiotensin receptor blo ckers (ARBs), angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and CCBs in reducing LVH (S7.2-11) . Hypertension adversely i mpacts other echocardio- graphic markers of cardiac structure and function, including left atrial size (both diameter and area; left atrial size is also a precurs or of AF); diastolic function (many parameters; a precursor of HF with preserved ejection fraction [HF pEF]); cardiac structure; and sub- clinical markers of LV systolic function, such as myocar- dial strain assessment with echocardiography and MRI. Assessment of LVH by means of echocardiography or MRI is not universally recommended during evaluation and management of hypertension in adults because t h e r ea r el i m i t e dd a t ao nt h ec o s ta n dv a l u eo ft h e s e measures for CVD risk reclassi ﬁcation and changes in type or intensity of treatment. Assessment of LVH is most useful in adults who are young (#18 years of age) or have evidence of secondary hypertension, chronic uncontrolled hypertension, or history of symptoms of HF. Electrocardiographic criteria for LVH correlate weakly with echocardiographic or MRI de ﬁnitions of LVH and are less strongly related to CVD outcomes (S7.2-12 — S7.2-15) . Imprecision in lead placement ac- counts, in part, for the poor correlation of electrocar- diographic measurements with direct imaging results. However, electrocardiographic LVH has been valuable in predicting CVD risk in some reports (S7.2-16,S7.2-17) . Electrocardiography may also be useful in the assess- ment of comorbidities, such as rhythm disturbances and prior MI.

MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e159 LVH, as assessed by electrocardiography, echocardi- ography, or MRI, is an independent predictor of CVD complications (S7.2-18,S7.2-19) .R e d u c t i o ni nL V Hc a n predict a reduction in CVD risk, independent of change in BP (S7.2-20) .W h e nu s e di nC V Dr i s kp r e d i c t o rm o d e l s , echocardiographic LVH has a small but signi ﬁcant inde- pendent effect on CVD risk in younger patients. At older ages, LVH measured by electrocardiography or MRI pro- vides no independent contribution to prediction of CVD risk (S7.2-21 — S7.2-23) . Patients can be classi ﬁed into 4 groups on the basis of the presence or absence of LVH and a determination of whethe r the LVH has an eccentric (normal relative wall thickness) or concentric geometry (S7.2-6,S7.2-22) . 8. TREATMENT OF HIGH BP Clinicians managing adults with high BP should focus on overall patient health, with a particular emphasis on reducing the risk of future adverse CVD outcomes. All patient risk factors need to be managed in an integrated fashion with a comprehensive set of nonpharmacological (see Section 6) and pharmacological strategies. As patient BP and risk of future CVD events increase, BP manage- ment should be intensiﬁed. 8.1. Pharmacological Treatment 8.1.1. Initiation of Pharmacological BP Treatment in the Context of Overall CVD Risk For any speciﬁc difference in BP, the relative risk of CVD is constant across groups that differ in absolute risk of atherosclerotic CVD (S8.1.1-1 — S8.1.1-4) , albeit with some evidence of lesser relative risk but greater excess risk in older than in younger adults (S8.1.1-5 — S8.1.1-8) .T h u s , there are more potentially preventable CVD events attributable to elevated BP in individuals with higher than with lower risk of CVD and in older than in younger adults. The relative risk reduction for CVD prevention with use of BP-lowering medications is fairly constant for groups that differ in CVD risk across a wide range of estimated absolute risk (S8.1.1-9,S8.1.1-10) and across groups de ﬁned by sex, age, body mass index, and the presence or absence of DM, AF, and CKD(S8.1.1-5,S8.1.1- 11— S8.1.1-21) . As a consequence, the absolute CVD risk reduction attributable to BP lowering is greater at greater absolute levels of CVD risk (S8.1.1-9,S8.1.1-10,S8.1.1- 12,S8.1.1-15 — S8.1.1-19,S8.1.1-22,S8.1.1-23) .P u ta n o t h e r way, for a given magnitude of BP reduction due to anti- hypertensive medications, fewer individuals at high CVD risk would need to be treated to prevent a CVD event (i.e., lower number needed to treat) than those at low CVD risk. Recommendations for BP Treatment Threshold and Use of Risk Estimation * to Guide Drug Treatment of Hypertension References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 23 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS I SBP: A 1. Use of BP-lowering medications is recommended for secondary prevention of recurrent CVD events in patients with clinical CVD and an average SBP of 130 mm Hg or higher or an average DBP of 80 mm Hg or higher, and for primary prevention in adults with an estimated 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of 10% or higher and an ave r a g eS B P1 3 0m mH go rh i g h e ro ra na v e r a g eD B P 80 mm Hg or higher(S8.1.2-1 — S8.1.2-9) . DBP: C-EO I C-LD 2. Use of BP-lowering medication isrecommended for primary prevention of CVD in adults with no history of CVD and with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk<10% and an SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher or a DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher(S8.1.2-3,S8.1.2-10 — S8.1.2-13) . *ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations (http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/) (S8.1.2-13a) to estimate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic CVD. ASCVD was deﬁned as aﬁrst CHD death, non-fatal MI or fatal or non-fatal stroke. 8.1.2. BP Treatment Threshold and the Use of CVD Risk Estimation to Guide Drug Treatment of Hypertension Synopsis Whereas treatment of high BP with BP-lowering medi- cations on the basis of BP level alone is considered cost effective (S8.1.2-14) , use of a combination of absolute CVD risk and BP level to guide such treatment is more efﬁcient and cost effective at reducing risk of CVD than is use of BP level alone (S8.1.2-15 — S8.1.2-24) . Practical approaches have been developed to translate evidence from RCTs into individual patient treatment recommendations that are based on absolute net beneﬁtf o rC V Dr i s k(S8.1.2-25) ,a n d several national and international guidelines recommend basing use of BP-lowering medications on a combination Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e160 of absolute risk of CVD and level of BP instead of relying solely on level of BP(S8.1.2-26 — S8.1.2-31) . Attempts to use absolute risk to guide implementation of pharmacological treatment to prevent CVD have had mixed results, with many reports of improvements in provider prescribing behaviors, patient adherence, and reductions in risk (S8.1.2-32 — S8.1.2-38) ,b u tw i t ho t h e r s showing no impact on provider behaviors (S8.1.2- 39,S8.1.2-40) . Use of global CVD risk assessment is infre- quent in routine clinical practice (S8.1.2-41 — S8.1.2-46) , which suggests that intensive efforts would be required to achieve universal implemen tation. The choice of speciﬁc risk calculators for estimation of risk and risk threshold has been an important source of variability, ambiguity, and controversy (S8.1.2-47 — S8.1.2-54) . In addition, implementation of a standard (worldwide) absolute CVD risk threshold for initiating use of BP-lowering medica- tions would result in large variations in medication use at a given level of BP across countries (S8.1.2-48,S8.1.2- 54,S8.1.2-55) . Future research in this area should focus on issues related to implementation of a risk-based approach to CVD prevention, including the use of BP-lowering medications. Although several CVD risk assessment tools are available, on the basis of current knowledge, we recommend use of the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations ( http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk- Estimator/ ) to estimate 10-year risk of atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) to establish the BP threshold for treatment (S8.1.2-56,S8.1.2-57) .I ts h o u l db ek e p ti nm i n dt h a tt h e ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations are validated for U.S. adults ages 40 to 79 years in the absence of concurrent statin therapy (S8.1.2-56) .F o rt h o s e>79 years old, the 10-year ASCVD risk is generally >10%, and thus the SBP threshold for antihypert ensive drug treatment for patients >79 years old is 130 mm Hg. Two recent reviews have highlighted the importance of using predicted CVD risk together with BP to guide antihypertensive drug therapy (S8.1.2-22,S8.1.2-23) . Figure 4 is an algorithm on BP thresholds and recom- mendations for treatment and follow-up. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. For the purposes of secondary prevention, clinical CVD is deﬁn e da sC H D ,c o n g e s t i v eH F ,a n ds t r o k e .S e v e r a l meta-analyses of RCTs support the value of using BP-lowering medications, in addition to non- pharmacological treatment, in patients with estab- lished CVD in the absence of hypertension, de ﬁned previously by an SBP$140 mm Hg or a DBP$90 mm Hg (S8.1.2-1,S8.1.2-6,S8.1.2-7,S8.1.2-9) .M a n yR C T so fB P lowering in adults without CVD have used inclusion criteria designed to increase the level of CVD risk in the study populations to increase trial ef ﬁciency by facilitating shorter duration and a smaller sample size. As a consequence, few relatively low-risk adults with hypertension have been included in the trials. Trial results provide evidence of CVD prevention from use of BP-lowering medications in adults with an average SBP $130 mm Hg or an average DBP$80 mm Hg and clinical CVD; 5-year risk of CVD (de ﬁned as stroke, CHD, HF, or other CVD death) of approximately 6% to 7% (S8.1.2-3,S8.1.2-5) ;a ne s t i m a t e d1 0 - y e a rC V Dd e a t h rate of approximately 4.5%(S8.1.2-4) ; or an annual rate of major CVD events of approximately 0.9% per year (S8.1.2-7) .I nt h ea b s e n c eo fc l i n i c a lC V D ,t h e s er i s k estimates are roughly equivalent to a 10-year risk of ASCVD exceeding 10% as per the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations (S8.1.2-56) . SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) provides additional sup- port for the use of BP-lowering medications in patients without CVD at SBP levels$130 mm Hg; however, it is important to note that few SPRINT participants had untreated SBP between 130 mm Hg and 139 mm Hg at baseline. Furthermore, SPRINT used a Framingham 10-year risk of general CVD exceeding 15% to identify increased CVD risk(S8.1.2-8) . Although this level of risk is lower than the levels described previously, being roughly equivalent to a 6% to 7% 10-year ASCVD risk per the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations, most of the participants in SPRINT had a much higher level of CVD risk. This recommendation differs from JNC 7 in its use of CVD risk, rather than diabetes or CKD, to recognize patients, including older adults, with a SBP/DBP<140/ 90 mm Hg who are likely to beneﬁtf r o mB Pl o w e r i n g drug therapy in addition to nonpharmacological anti- hypertensive treatment. In JNC 7, the BP threshold for initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy was $ 140/ 90 mm Hg for the general adult population and$ 130/ 80 mm Hg for adults with diabetes or CKD. Since the publication of JNC 7 in 2003, we have gained additional experience with risk assessment and new data from randomized trials, observational studies and simula- tion analyses have demonstrated that antihypertensive drug treatment based on overall ASCVD risk assess- ment combined with BP levels may prevent more CVD events than treatment based on BP levels alone(S8.1.2- 15— S8.1.2-24) . According to an analysis of NHANES 2011-2014, the new de ﬁnition results in only a small increase in the percentage of U.S. adults for whom antihypertensive medication is recommended in conjunction with lifestyle modiﬁcation. The previously cited meta-analyses are consistent with the conclusion that lowering of BP results in bene ﬁti nh i g h e r - r i s k individuals, regardless of their baseline treated or untreated BP $130/80 mm Hg and irrespective of the speci ﬁc cause of their elevated risk. These analyses indicate that the bene ﬁto ft r e a t m e n to u t w e i g h st h e potential harm at threshold BP $130/80 mm Hg. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e161 2. This recommendation is consistent with prior guide- lines, such as JNC 7. In addition, for those for whom nonpharmacological therapy has been ineffective, antihypertensive drug treatment should be added in patients with an SBP $140 mm Hg or a DBP $90 mm Hg, even in adults who are at lower risk than those included in RCTs. The rationale for drug treatment in patients with an SBP$140 mm Hg or a DBP$90 mm Hg and an estimated 10-year risk of CVD<10% is based on several lines of evidence. First, the relationship of SBP with risk of CVD is known to be continuous across levels of SBP and similar across groups that differ in level of absolute risk (S8.1.2-10) . Second, the relative risk reduction attributable to BP-lowering medication therapy is consistent across the range of absolute risk observed in trials (S8.1.2-3,S8.1.2-11,S8.1.2-58) , supporting the contention that the relative risk reduction may be similar at lower levels of absolute risk. This is the case even in a meta-analysis of trials in adults without clinical CVD and an average SBP/DBP of 146/84 mm Hg (S8.1.2-5) . Finally, modeling studies support the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatment of younger, lower-risk patients over the course of their life spans(S8.1.2-12,S8.1.2-13) .A l t h o u g h the numbers needed to treat with BP-lowering medi- cations to prevent a CVD event in the short term are greater in younger, lower-risk individuals with hypertension than in older, higher-risk adults with hypertension, the estimated gains in life expectancy attributable to long-term use of BP-lowering medica- tions are correspondingly g reater in younger, lower- risk individuals than in older adults with a higher FIGURE 4 Blood Pressure (BP) Thresholds and Recommendations for Treatment and Follow-Up Colors correspond to Class of Recommendation inTable 1. *Using the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations(S8.1.2-56,S8.1.2-57). Note that patients with DM or CKD are automatically placed in the high-risk category. For initiation of RAS inhibitor or diuretic therapy, assess blood tests for electrolytes and renal function 2 to 4 weeks after initiating therapy.†Consider initiation of pharmacological therapy for stage 2 hypertension with 2 antihypertensive agents of different classes. Patients with stage 2 hypertension and BP$160/100 mm Hg should be promptly treated, carefully monitored, and subject to upward medication dose adjustment as necessary to control BP. Reassessment includes BP measurement, detection of orthostatic hypotension in selected patients (e.g., older or with postural symptoms), identiﬁcation of white coat hypertension or a white coat effect, documentation of adherence, monitoring of the response to therapy, reinforcement of the importance of adherence, reinforcement of the importance of treatment, and assistance with treatment to achieve BP target.

Indirect support is also provided by evidence from trials using BP-lowering medications to reduce the risk of developing higher levels of BP (S8.1.2-59 — S8.1.2-61) and, in one case, to achieve a reduction in LV mass (S8.1.2-62) .I nt h e HOPE-3 (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation-3) BP Trial, there was no evidence of short-term bene ﬁt during treatment of adults (average age 66 years) with a relatively low risk of CVD (3.8% CVD event rate during 5.6 years of follow-up). However, subgroup analysis suggested bene ﬁt in those with an average SBP approximately >1 4 0m mH g( a n daC V Dr i s ko f 6.5% during the 5.6 years of follow-up)(S8.1.2-63) .W e acknowledge the importance of excluding white coat hypertension before initiating pharmacological ther- apy in hypertensive patients with low ASCVD risk. This may be accomplished (as described in Section 4 )b y HBPM or ABPM as appropriate. 8.1.3. Follow-Up After Initial BP Evaluation Recommendations for Follow-U p After Initial BP Evaluation References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 24 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS I B-R 1. Adults with an elevated BP or stage 1 hypertension who have an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk less than 10% should be managed with nonpharmacological therapy and have a repeat BP evaluation within 3 to 6m o n t h s(S8.1.3-1,S8.1.3-2) . I B-R 2. Adults with stage 1 hypertension who have an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of 10% or higher should be managed initially with a combination of nonpharmacological and antihypertens ive drug therapy and have a repeat BP evaluation in 1 month(S8.1.3-1,S8.1.3-2) . I B-R 3. Adults with stage 2 hypertension should be evaluated by or referred to a primary care provider within 1 month of the initial diagnosis, have a combination of nonpharmacological and antihypertensive drug therapy (with 2 agents of different classes) initiated, and have a repeat BP evaluation in 1 month (S8.1.3-1,S8.1.3-2) . I B-R 4 .F o ra d u l t sw i t hav e r yh i g ha v e r a g eB P( e . g . ,S B P‡180 mm Hg or DBP‡110 mm Hg), evaluation followed by prompt antihypertensive dr ug treatment is recommended (S8.1.3-1,S8.1.3-2) . IIa C-EO 5. For adults with a normal BP, repeat evaluation every year is reasonable. Synopsis An important component of BP management in hyper- tensive patients is follow-up. Different periods of time for follow-up are recommended depending on the stage of hypertension, the presence or absence of target organ damage, treatment with antihypertensive medications, and the level of BP control. Recommendations for follow- up are summarized inFigure 4. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Nonpharmacological therapy (see Section 6.2 )i st h e preferred therapy for adults with elevated BP and an appropriate ﬁrst-line therapy for adults with stage 1 hypertension who have an e stimated 10-year ASCVD risk of <10%. Adherence to and impact of non- pharmacological therapy should be assessed within 3 to 6m o n t h s . 2. Nonpharmacological therapy can help reduce BP in patients with stage 1 hypertension with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of $10% and should be used in addition to pharmacological therapy as ﬁrst-line ther- apy in such patients (seeSection 6.2). 3. Prompt evaluation and treatment of patients with stage 2 hypertension with a combination of drug and non- pharmacological therapy are important because of the elevated risk of CVD events in this subgroup, especially those with multiple ASCVD risk factors or target organ damage (S8.1.3-1,S8.1.3-2) . 4. Prompt management of very high BP is important to reduce the risk of target organ damage (see Section 11.2). The rapidity of the treatment needed is depen- dent on the patient’s clinical presentation (presence of new or worsening target organ damage) and presence or absence of CVD complications, but treatment should be initiated within at least 1 week. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e163 5. Given that the lifetime risk of hypertension exceeds 80% in U.S. adults(S8.1.3-3) , it is likely that individuals with a normal BP will develop elevated BP in the future. BP may change over time because of changes in BP-related lifestyle factors, such as degree of sedentary lifestyle, dietary sodiu m intake, body weight, and alcohol intake. Less commonly, secondary causes of hypertension can occur over time and lead to an in- crease in BP. Periodic BP screening can identify in- dividuals who develop elevated BP over time. More frequent BP screening may be particularly important for individuals with elevated ASCVD risk. 8.1.4. General Principles of Drug Therapy Recommendation for General Principle of Drug Therapy References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 25 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION III: Harm A 1. Simultaneous use of an ACE inhibitor, ARB, and/or renin inhibitor is potentially harmful and is not recommended to treat adults with hypertension (S8.1.4-1 — S8.1.4-3) . Synopsis Pharmacological agents, in addition to lifestyle modiﬁ- cation (see Section 6.2 ), provide the primary basis for treatment of high BP. A large number of clinical trials have demonstrated that antihypert ensive pharmacotherapy not only lowers BP but reduces the risk of CVD, cerebrovas- cular events, and death (S8.1.4-4 — S8.1.4-7) . Numerous classes of antihypertensive agents are available to treat high BP (Table 18). Agents that have been shown to reduce clinical events should be used preferen- tially. Therefore, the primary agents used in the treatment of hypertension include thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs (S8.1.4-8 — S8.1.4-11) (see Section 8.1.6 ). Although many other drugs and drug classes are available, either con ﬁrmation that these agents decrease clinical outcomes to an extent similar to that of the primary agents is lacking, or safety and tolerability may relegate their role to use as secondary agents. In particular, there is inade- quate evidence to support the initial use of beta blockers f o rh y p e r t e n s i o ni nt h ea b s e n c eo fs p e c iﬁc cardiovascular comorbidities (see Section 9). When the initial drug treatment of high BP is being considered, several different strategies may be contem- plated. Many patients can be started on a single agent, but consideration should be given to starting with 2 drugs of different classes for those with stage 2 hypertension (see Section 8.1.6.1 ). In addition, other patient-speciﬁcf a c t o r s , such as age, concurrent medications, drug adherence, drug interactions, the overal l treatment regimen, out-of- p o c k e tc o s t s ,a n dc o m o r b i d i t i e s ,s h o u l db ec o n s i d e r e d . From a societal perspective, total costs must be taken into account. Shared decision making, with the patient in ﬂu- e n c e db yc l i n i c i a nj u d g m e n t ,s h o u l dd r i v et h eu l t i m a t e choice of antihypertensive agent(s). Many patients started on a single agent will subsequently require $2 drugs from different pharmacological classes to reach their BP goals (S8.1.4-12,S8.1.4-13,S8.1.4-14) . Knowledge of the pharmacological mechanisms of action of each agent is important. Drug regimens with complemen- tary activity, where a second antihypertensive agent is used to block compensatory responses to the initial agent or affect a different pressor mechanism, can result in additive lowering of BP. For exampl e, thiazide diuretics may stimulate the renin-angioten sin-aldosterone system. By adding an ACE inhibitor or ARB to the thiazide, an additive BP-lowering effect may be obtained (S8.1.4-13) .U s eo f combination therapy may also improve adherence. Several 2- and 3-ﬁxed-dose drug combinations of antihypertensive drug therapy are available, with complementary mecha- nisms of action among the components ( Online Data Supplement D ). However, it should be noted that many triple-dose combinations may contain a lower-than- optimal dose of thiazide diuretic. Table 18 is a summary of oral antihypertensive drugs. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Drug combinations that have similar mechanisms of action or clinical effects should be avoided. For example, 2 drugs from the same class should not be administered together (e.g., 2 different beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, or nondihydropyridine CCBs). Likewise, 2 drugs from classes that target the same BP control system are less effective and potentially harmful when used together (e.g., ACE inhibitors, ARBs). Exceptions to this rule include concomitant use of a thiazide diuretic, K-sparing diuretic, and/or loop diuretic in various combinations. Also, dihydropyridine and non- dihydropyridine CCBs can be combined. High-quality RCT data demonstrate that simultaneous administra- tion of RAS blockers (i.e., ACE inhibitor with ARB; ACE inhibitor or ARB with renin inhibitor aliskiren) increases cardiovascular and renal risk (S8.1.4-1 — S8.1.4-3) .

BP Goal for Patients With Hypertension Synopsis Refer to the“Systematic Review for the 2017 ACC/AHA/ AAPA/ABC/ACPM/AGS/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA Guide- line for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults ” for the complete systematic evidence review for additional data and analyses (S8.1.5-10). Several trials have tested whether more intensive BP control improves major CVD outcomes. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews of these trials pro- vide strong support for the more intensive approach, but the data are less clear in identiﬁcation of a speciﬁco p t i m a l BP target (S8.1.5-1— S8.1.5-5,S8.1.5-7,S8.1.5-11 — S8.1.5-13). Recent trials that address optimal BP targets include SPRINT and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes), with targets for more intensive (SBP <120 mm Hg) and standard (SBP<140 mm Hg) treatment(S8.1.5- 14,S8.1.5-15) , and SPS-3, with a more intensive target of <130/80 mm Hg (S8.1.5-16). These trials yielded mixed results in achieving their primary endpoints. SPRINT was stopped early, after a median follow-up of 3.26 years, when more intensive treatment resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in the primary outcome (a CVD composite) and in all-cause mortality rate. In ACCORD, more intensive BP treatment failed to demonstrate a signiﬁcant reduction in the primary outcome (a CVD composite). However, the incidence of stroke, a component of the primary outcome, was signiﬁ- cantly reduced. The standard glycemia subgroup did show signiﬁcant beneﬁt in ACCORD, and a meta-analysis of the only 2 trials (ACCORD and SPRINT) testing an SBP goal of <1 2 0m mH gs h o w e ds i g n iﬁcant reduction in CVD events (S8.1.5-17). SPS-3 failed to demonstrate bene ﬁtf o rt h e primary endpoint of recurrent stoke (p¼0.08) but found a signiﬁcant reduction in a subgroup with hemorrhagic stroke. Pooling of the experience from 19 trials (excluding SPRINT) that randomly assigned participants to different BP treatment targets identiﬁed a signiﬁcant reduction in CVD events, MI, and stroke in those assigned to a lower (average achieved SBP/DBP was 133/76 mm Hg) versus a higher BP treatment target (S8.1.5-2). Similar patterns of beneﬁtw e r e reported in 3 other meta-analyses of trials in which partic- ipants were randomly assigned to different BP targets (S8.1.5-3— S8.1.5-5) and in larger meta-analyses that addi- tionally included trials that compared different intensities of treatment (S8.1.5-12). Data from the most recent meta- analysis (42 trials and 144,220 patients) (S8.1.5-5) demon- strate a linear association between mean achieved SBP and risk of CVD mortality with the lowest risk at 120 to 124 mm Hg. The totality of the available information pro- vides evidence that a lower BP target is generally better than a higher BP target and that some patients will beneﬁt from an SBP treatment goal <120 mm Hg, especially those at high risk of CVD (S8.1.5-15).T h es p e c iﬁc inclusion and exclusion criteria of any RCT may limit extrapolation to a more general population with hypertension. In addition, all of the relevant trials have been efﬁcacy studies in which BP measurements were more consistent with guideline recommendations than is common in clinical practice, resulting in lower absolute values for SBP. For both of these reasons, the SBP target recommended during BP lowering (<130 mm Hg) is higher than that which was used in SPRINT. Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. Meta-analysis and systematic review of trials that compare more intensive BP reduction to standard BP reduction report that more intense BP lowering signiﬁ- cantly reduces the risk of stroke, coronary events, major cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality (S8.1.5-1) .I nas t r a t iﬁed analysis of these data, achieving an additional 10–m mH gr e d u c t i o ni nS B Pr e d u c e dC V D risk when compared with an average SBP of 158/82 to 143/76 mm Hg, 144/85 to 137/81 mm Hg, and 134/79 to 125/76 mm Hg. Patients with DM and CKD were included in the analysis (S8.1.5-1,S8.1.5-2,S8.1.5-11 — S8.1.5- 13,S8.1.5-18) .( S p e c iﬁc management details are in Section 9.3 for CKD andSection 9.6 for DM.)

COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS I SBP: B-R SR 1. For adults with conﬁrmed hypertension and known CVD or 10-year ASCVD event risk of 10% or higher (see Section 8.1.2 ), a BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg is recommended(S8.1.5-1 — S8.1.5-5) .DBP: C-EO IIb SBP: B-NR 2.

The treatment of patients with hypertension without elevated risk has been sys tematically understudied because lower-risk group s would require prolonged follow-up to have a sufﬁcient number of clinical events to provide useful information. Although there is clin- ical trial evidence that both drug and nondrug therapy will interrupt the progressive course of hypertension (S8.1.5-6) , there is no trial evidence that this treatment decreases CVD morbidity and mortality. The clinical trial evidence is strongest for a target BP of 140/90 mm Hg in this population. However, observational studies suggest that these individuals often have a high lifetime risk and would beneﬁt from BP control earlier in life (S8.1.5-19,S8.1.5-20) . 8.1.6. Choice of Initial Medication Recommendation for Choice of Initial Medication References that support the recommendation are summarized in Online Data Supplement 27 and Systematic Review Report. COR LOE RECOMMENDATION IA SR 1 .F o ri n i t i a t i o no fa n t i h y pertensive drug therapy, ﬁrst-line agents include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs. (S8.1.6-1,S8.1.6-2) SR indicates systematic review. Synopsis The overwhelming majority of persons with BP suf ﬁ- ciently elevated to warrant pharmacological therapy may be best treated initially with 2 agents (seeSection 8.1.6.1 ). When initiation of pharmacological therapy with a single medication is appropriate, primary consideration should be given to comorbid conditions (e.g., HF, CKD) for which speci ﬁc classes of BP-lowering medication are indicated (see Section 9 ) (S8.1.6-1) . In the largest head-to-head comparison of ﬁrst-step drug therapy for hypertension (S8.1.6-3) , the thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone was superior to the CCB amlodipine and the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in preventing HF , a BP-related outcome of increasing importance in the growing population of older persons with hypertension (S8.1.6-4 — S8.1.6-7) . Addition- ally, ACE inhibitors were less effective than thiazide di- uretics and CCBs in lowering BP and in prevention of stroke. For black patients, ACE inhibitors were also n o t a b l yl e s se f f e c t i v et h a nC C B si np r e v e n t i n gH F(S8.1.6- 8) and in the prevention of stroke (S8.1.6-9) (see Section 10.1). ARBs may be better tolerated than ACE inhibitors in black patients, with less cough and angioedema, but according to the limited available experience they offer no proven advantage over ACE inhibitors in preventing stroke or CVD in this population, making thiazide diuretics (especially chlorthalidone) or CCBs the best initial choice f o rs i n g l e - d r u gt h e r a p y .F o rstroke, in the general popu- lation, beta blockers were l ess effective than CCBs (36% lower risk) and thiazide diuretics (30% lower risk). CCBs have been shown to be as effective as diuretics for reducing all CVD events other than HF, and CCBs are a good alternative choice for initial therapy when thiazide diuretics are not tolerated. Alpha blockers are not used as ﬁrst-line therapy for hypertension because they are less effective for prevention of CVD than other ﬁrst-step agents, such as thiazide diuretics (S8.1.6-3,S8.1.6-10) . Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. The overall goal of treatment should be reduction in BP, in the context of underlying CVD risk. Five drug classes have been shown, in high-quality RCTs, to prevent CVD as compared with placebo (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, CCBs, and beta blockers) (S8.1.6-11,S8.1.6-12) .I n head-to-head comparisons of ﬁrst-step therapy, different drug classes have been reported to provide somewhat divergent capacity to prevent speci ﬁcC V D events. Interpretation o f meta-analyses comparing agents from different drug classes is challenging because the relevant RCTs were conducted in different time periods, during which concurrent antihyperten- sive therapy was less or more common, and the efﬁcacy of agents from certain drug classes may have changed. In recognition of this, some(S8.1.6-2) but not all(S8.1.6- 11,S8.1.6-12) meta-analyses, as well as the largest indi- vidual RCT that compared ﬁrst-step agents (S8.1.6-3) , have suggested that diuretics, especially the long-acting thiazide-type agent chlorthalidone, may provide an optimal choice for ﬁrst-step drug therapy of hyperten- sion. In contrast, some meta-analyses have suggested that beta blockers may be less effective, especially for stroke prevention in older adults, but interpretation is hampered by inclusion of RCTs that used beta blockers that are now considered to be inferior for prevention of CVD (S8.1.6-13,S8.1.6-14) .I nas y s t e m a t i cr e v i e w and network meta-analysis conducted for the present guideline, beta blockers were signi ﬁcantly less effective than diuretics for prevention of stroke and cardiovascular events (S8.1.6-1) . Diuretics were also Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e168 signi ﬁcantly better than CCBs for prevention of HF. There were some other nonsigni ﬁcant differences between diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs, but the general pattern was for similarity in effect. As indicated in Section 8.1.6.1 ,m o s ta d u l t sw i t h hypertension require >1 drug to control their BP. As recommended in Section 10.1, for black adults with hypertension (without HF or CKD), initial antihyper- tensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic or CCB. 8.1.6.1. Choice of Initial Monotherapy Versus Initial Combination Drug Therapy Recommendations for Choice of Initial Monotherapy Versus Initial Combination Drug Therapy * COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS I C-EO 1. Initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with 2 ﬁrst-line agents of different classes, either as separate agents or in aﬁxed-dose combination, is recommended in adults with stage 2 hypertension and an average BP more than 20/10 mm Hg above their BP target. IIa C-EO 2. Initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with a single antihypertensive drug is reasonable in adults with stage 1 hypertension and BP goal<130/80 mm Hg with dosage titration and sequential addition of other agents to achieve the BP target. *Fixed-dose combination antihypertensive medications are listed inOnline Data Supplement D. Synopsis Systematic review of the evidence comparing the initi- ation of antihypertensive treatment with monotherapy and sequential (stepped-care) titration of additional agents versus initiation of treatment with combination therapy (including ﬁxed-dose combinations) did not identify any RCTs meeting the systematic review ques- tions posed in the PICOTS format (P ¼population, I¼intervention, C ¼comparator, O ¼outcome, T ¼timing, S¼setting). However, in both ACCORD and SPRINT, 2-drug therapy was recommended for most participants in the intensive- but not standard-therapy groups. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Because most patients with hypertension require mul- tiple agents for control of their BP and those with higher BPs are at greater risk, more rapid titration of antihy- pertensive medications began to be recommended in patients with BP >20/10 mm Hg above their target, beginning with the JNC 7 report (S8.1.6.1-1) .I nt h e s e patients, initiation of antihypertensive therapy with 2 agents is recommended. Evidence favoring this approach comes mostly from studies using ﬁxed-dose combination products showing greater BP lowering with ﬁxed-dose combination agents than with single agents, as well as better adherence to therapy(S8.1.6.1- 2,S8.1.6.1-3) .T h es a f e t ya n de fﬁcacy of this strategy have been demonstrated in adults to reduce BPs to <140/90 mm Hg though not compared with other strategies (S8.1.6.1-4 — S8.1.6.1-6) . In general, this approach is reasonable in older adults, those at high CVD risk, or those who have a history of hypotension or drug-associated side effects. However, caution is advised in initiating antihypertensive pharmacotherapy with 2 drugs in older patients because hypotension or orthostatic hypotension ma y develop in some patients; BP should be carefully monitored. 2. The stepped-care approach deﬁned by the initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with a single agent followed by the sequential titration of the dose and addition of other agents has been the recommended treatment strategy since the ﬁrst report of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (S8.1.6.1-7) . This approach is also reasonable in older adults or those at risk or who have a history of hypotension or drug- associated side effects. This strategy has been used successfully in nearly all hypertension treatment trials but has not been formally tested against other antihy- pertensive drug treatment strategies for effectiveness in achieving BP control or in preventing adverse outcomes. 8.2. Achieving BP Control in Individual Patients Recommendations for lifestyle modi ﬁcations and drug selection are speci ﬁed in Sections 6.2 , 8.1.4 ,a n d8.1.6 . Initial drug selections should be based on trial evidence of treatment ef ﬁcacy, combined with recognition of compelling indications for use of an agent from a speciﬁc drug class, as well as the individual patient ’s lifestyle preferences and traits. For a subset of patients (25% to 50%) (S8.2-1) , the initial drug therapy will be well tolerated and effective in achieving the desired level of BP, with only the need for subsequent monitoring JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e169 (see Section 8.3 for an appropriate follow-up schedule). For others, the initial drug will not be tolerated or will not be effective, requiring either a change in medication or addition of another medication, followed by BP monitoring (S8.2-2) . Approximately 25% of patients will require additional treatment adjustments. In a minority of this group, achievement of goal BP can be challenging. I np a t i e n t sw h od on o tr e s p o n dt oo rd on o tt o l e r a t e treatment with 2 to 3 medications or medication combi- nations, additional trials of treatment tend to be ineffec- tive or poorly tolerated. Some patients may become disillusioned and lost to follow-up, whereas others will identify an alternative healthcare provider, including nontraditional healers, or will try popular home remedies. Working with this more demanding subset requires pro- vider expertise, patience, and a mechanism to respond efﬁc i e n t l ya n ds e n s i t i v e l yt oc o n c e r n sa st h e ya r i s e .I n this setting, team-based care (see Section 12 )m a yb e effective, encouraging coupling of nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments, while improving access to and communication with care providers. In the setting of medication intolerance, consider allowing a deﬁn e dp e r i o do ft i m et oe v a l u a t et h ee f f e c t so f lifestyle modi ﬁcation in patients with a relatively low CVD risk (10-year risk of ASCVD <10%, based on the ASCVD Risk Estimator [ http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk- Estimator ]), with scheduled follow-up visits for assess- ment of BP levels, including a review of HBPM data, and an appraisal of lifestyle change goal achievements. For patients with a higher level of CVD risk or with signiﬁcant elevations in BP (SBP or DBP >20 or >10 mm Hg above target, respectively), medication is usually started even while the patient is pursuing lifestyle change (see Section 8.1.2). Consideration of patient comorbidities, lifestyle, and preferences may suggest better tolerance or greater effect from one class of medication versus other classes. For example, if hyponatremia is present, it would be impor- tant to avoid or stop thiazide diuretic therapy. In this case, a loop diuretic should be used if a diuretic is required. If hypokalemia is present, primary or secondary aldosteronism should be excluded, after which one should consider a potassium-sparing agent, such as spi- ronolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride. In addition, reducing dietary sodium intake will diminish urinary potassium losses. If the patient has chronic cough or a history of ACE inhibitor–induced cough or develops a cough or bronchial responsiveness while on an ACE in- hibitor, one should use an ARB in place of an ACE inhib- itor. For patients with bronchospastic lung disease, a beta-1-selective blocker (e.g., bisoprolol, metoprolol) should be considered if beta-blocker therapy is required. A patient who is already adherent to lifestyle change recommendations, including diligent reduction in sodium intake, may show a greater response to a RAS blocker. Prior patient experience should be considered, as in the case of cough associated with prior use of an ACE inhibi- tor, which is likely to reoccur if an agent from the same c l a s si sp r e s c r i b e d . 8.3. Follow-Up of BP During Antihypertensive Drug Therapy Appropriate follow-up and monitoring enable assessment of adherence (see Section 12.1 ) and response to therapy, help identify adverse responses to therapy and target organ damage, and allow assessment of progress toward treatment goals. High-quality RCTs have successfully and safely developed strategies for follow-up, monitoring, and reassessment from which recommendations can be made (Figure 4) (S8.2-1,S8.2-2) . A systematic approach to out-of-of ﬁce BP assessment is an essential part of follow- up and monitoring of BP, to assess response to therapy; check for evidence of white coat hypertension, white coat effect, masked hypertension, or masked uncontrolled hypertension; and help achieve BP targets (seeSections 4 and 12). 8.3.1.

Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Systematic approaches to follow-up have been shown to improve hypertension control and can be adapted and incorporated into clinical practices according to local needs and resource availability (see Section 8.3.1 for time intervals for treatment follow-up and monitoring and Sections 12.2 and 12.3.2 on systematic strategies to improve BP control). 9. HYPERTENSION IN PATIENTS WITH COMORBIDITIES Certain comorbidities may affect clinical decision-making in hypertension. These include ischemic heart disease, HF with reduced ejection fraction (HF rEF), HFpEF, CKD (including renal transplantation), cerebrovascular disease, AF, PAD, DM, and metabolic syndrome(S9-1) .A sn o t e di n Section 8.1.2, this guideline generally recommends use of BP-lowering medications for secondary prevention of CVD in patients with clinical CVD (CHD, HF, and stroke) and an average BP $130/80 mm Hg and for primary prevention of CVD in adults with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of $10% and an average SBP $130 mm Hg or an average DBP $80 mm Hg. Although we recommend use of the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations ( http://tools.acc.org/ ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/ ) to estimate 10-year risk of ASCVD to establish the BP threshold for treatment, the vast majority of adults with a co-morbidity are likely to have a 10-year risk of ASCVD that exceeds 10%. In some instances, clinical trial con ﬁrmation of treatment in pa- tients with comorbidities is limited to a target BP of 140/90 mm Hg. In addition, the selection of medications for use in treating high BP in patients with CVD is guided by their use for other compelling indications (e.g., beta blockers after MI, ACE inhibitors for HFrEF), as discussed in spe- ciﬁc guidelines for the clinical condition(S9-2 — S9-4) .T h e present guideline does not address the recommendations for treatment of hypertension occurring with acute coro- nary syndromes.

Stable Ischemic Heart Disease Synopsis Hypertension is a major risk factor for ischemic heart disease. Numerous RCTs have demonstrated the beneﬁts of antihypertensive drug therapy in reducing the risk of ischemic heart disease. The following recommendations apply only to management of hypertension in patients with SIHD without HF. See Section 9.2 for recommenda- tions for the treatment of patients with SIHD and HF. Figure 5 is an algorithm on management of hyperten- sion in patients with SIHD. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In patients with increased cardiovascular risk, reduc- tion of SBP to <130/80 mm Hg has been shown to reduce CVD complications by 25% and all-cause mor- t a l i t yb y2 7 %(S9.1-1) . 2. After 5 years of randomized therapy in high-CVD-risk patients, ramipril produced a 22% reduction in MI, stroke, or CVD compared with placebo (S9.1-10) .N o added bene ﬁt on CVD outcomes was seen when compared with CCBs and diuretics (S9.1-15,S9.1-16) . After 4.2 years of randomized therapy in patients with SIHD, perindopril reduced CVD death, MI, or cardiac arrest by 20% compared with placebo (S9.1-7) .B e t a blockers are effective drugs for preventing angina pectoris, improving exercise time until the onset of angina pectoris, reducing exercise-induced ischemic ST-segment depression, and preventing coronary events (S9.1-8,S9.1-17 — S9.1-22) .

Adults with SIHD and hypertension (BP‡130/80 mm Hg) should be treated with medications (e.g., GDMT (S9.1-6) beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs) for compelling indications (e.g., previous MI, stable angina) as ﬁrst-line therapy, with the addition of other drugs (e.g., dihydropyridine CCBs, thiazide diuretics, and/or mineralocortic oid receptor antagonists) as neede d to further control hypertension (S9.1-7 — S9.1-10) . DBP: C-EO I B-NR 3. In adults with SIHD with angina and persistent uncontrolled hypertension, the addition of dihydropyridine CCBs to GDMT (S9.1-6) beta blockers is recommended (S9.1-8,S9.1-11,S9.1-12) . IIa B-NR 4. In adults who have had a MI or acute coronary syndrome, it is reasonable to continue GDMT(S9.1-6) beta blockers beyond 3 years as long-term therapy for hypertension (S9.1-13,S9.1-14) . IIb C-EO 5. Beta blockers and/or CCBs might be considered to control hypertension in patients with CAD (without HFrEF) who had an MI more than 3 years ago and have angina. FIGURE 5 Management of Hypertension in Patients With SIHD Colors correspond to Class of Recommendation inTable 1. *GDMT beta blockers for BP control or relief of angina include carvedilol, meto- prolol tartrate, metoprolol succinate, nadolol, bisoprolol, propranolol, and timolol.

The beta blocker atenolol should not be used because it is less effective than placebo in reducing cardiovascular events.†If needed for BP control. ACE indicates angiotensin-converting enzyme; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; BP, blood pressure; CCB, calcium channel blocker; GDMT, guideline-directed management and therapy; and SIHD, stable ischemic heart disease.

GDMT beta blockers for SIHD that are also effective in lowering BP include carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate, metoprolol succinate, nadolol, bisoprolol, propranolol, and timolol. Atenolol is not as effective as other antihypertensive drugs in the treatment of hy- pertension (S9.1-23) . 3. Dihydropyridine CCBs are effective antianginal drugs that can lower BP and relieve angina pectoris when added to beta blockers in patients in whom hyperten- sion is present and angina pectoris persists despite beta-blocker therapy (S9.1-8,S9.1-17,S9.1-19 — S9.1- 22,S9.1-24,S9.1-25) . GDMT beta blockers for SIHD that are also effective in lowering BP include carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate, metoprolol succinate, nadolol, bisoprolol, propranolol, and timolol. 4. In randomized long-term trials, use of beta blockers after MI reduced all-cause mortality by 23% (S9.1-13) . Given the established ef ﬁcacy of beta blockers for treating hypertension and SIHD, their use for treat- ment continuing beyond 3 years after MI is reasonable (S9.1-6,S9.1-25) . 5. GDMT beta blockers and CCBs are effective antihy- pertensive and antianginal agents. CCBs include dihy- dropyridine and nondihydropyridine agents. CCBs can be used separately or together with beta blockers beginning 3 years after MI in patients with CAD who have both hypertension and angina. 9.2.

COR LOE RECOMMENDATION I SBP: B-R 1. In adults at increased risk of HF, the optimal BP in those with hypertension should be less than 130/80 mm Hg (S9.2-1 — S9.2-3) .DBP: C-EO Synopsis Antecedent hypertension is present in 75% of patients with chronic HF (S9.2-4) .I nt h eC a r d i o v a s c u l a rH e a l t h Study (S9.2-5) and the Health, Aging and Body Composi- tion Study (S9.2-6) , 11.2% of 4408 persons (53.1% women, with a mean age of 72.8 years, living in the community, and not receiving antihypertensive drugs at baseline) d e v e l o p e dH Fo v e r1 0y e a r s(S9.2-7) .C o m p a r e dw i t ht h o s e with an average SBP<120 mm Hg, the adjusted incidence of HF was increased 1.6, 2.2, and 2.6 times in those with average SBPs between 120 and 139 mm Hg, between 140 and 159 mm Hg, and$160 mm Hg, respectively (S9.2-7) . No RCTs are available that compare one BP-lowering agent to another for the management of patients with HF. The following recommendations for treatment of hy- pertension in HF are based on use of drugs that lower BP and also have compelling indications for management of HF (with HFrEF or HFpEF) as recommended in current ACC/AHA guidelines (S9.2-4,S9.2-8) . Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In adults with hypertension (SBP $130 mm Hg or DBP $80 mm Hg) and a high risk of CVD, a strong body of evidence supports treatment with antihyper- tensive medications (see Section 8.1.2 )a n dm o r e - intensive rather than less-intensive intervention (see Section 8.1.5 ). In SPRINT, a more intensive intervention that targeted an SBP <120 mm Hg signi ﬁcantly reduced the primary outcome (CVD composite) by about 25% (S9.2-9) . The incidence of HF, a component of the primary outcome, was also substantially decreased (hazard ratio: 0.62; 95% conﬁdence interval: 0.45 –0.84). Meta-analyses of clinical trials have identi ﬁed a similar beneﬁcial effect of more-intensive BP reduction on the incidence of HF (S9.2-2,S9.2-10) , but the body of information from studies con ﬁned to trials that randomly assigned participants to different BP targets is more limited and less compelling (S9.2-3) . In addition, the available trials were efﬁcacy studies in which BP measurements were more consistent with guideline recommenda- t i o n st h a ni sc o m m o ni nc l i n i c a lp r a c t i c e ,r e s u l t i n gi n lower absolute values for SBP. For both of these reasons, the SBP target recommended during BP lowering ( <130 mm Hg) is higher than that used in SPRINT. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al.

Large-scale RCTs have shown that antihypertensive drug therapy reduces the incidence of HF in patients with hypertension (S9.2.1-8 — S9.2.1-11) . In ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treat- ment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial), chlorthalidone reduced the risk of HF rEF more than amlodipine and doxazosin but similarly to lisinopril (S9.2.1-12,S9.2.1-13) . Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. This recommendation is based on guidance in the 2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA guideline f ocused update on heart failure (S9.2.1-14) (see ﬁgure from the HF focused up- date that is reproduced inOnline Data Supplement A). Lifestyle modi ﬁcation, such as weight loss and sodium reduction, may serve as adjunctive measures to help these agents work better. No RCT evidence is available to support the superiority of one BP-lowering medica- tion with compelling indications for treatment of HFrEF over another. Medications with compelling in- dications for HF that may be used asﬁrst-line therapy to treat high BP include ACE inhibitors or ARBs, angiotensin receptor –neprilysin inhibitors, mineralo- corticoid receptor antagonists, diuretics, and GDMT beta blockers (carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol). Clinical trials evaluating goal BP reduction and optimal BP-lowering agents in the setting of HFrEF and concom- itant hypertension have not been performed. However, in patients at higher CVD risk, BP lowering is associated with fewer adverse cardiovascular events (S9.2.1-7) .G D M Tf o r HFrEF with agents known to lower BP should consider a goal BP reduction consistent with a threshold now asso- ciated with improved clinical outcomes but not yet proven by RCTs in an HF population. 2. Nondihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil, diltiazem) have myocardial depressant activity.

JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e174 Synopsis Approximately 50% of patients with HF have HF pEF (S9.2.2-2,S9.2.2-7 — S9.2.2-11) . The ejection fraction in these studies has varied from >40% to $55% (S9.2.2-2) . Patients with HF pEF are usually older women with a history of hypertension. Obesity, CHD, DM, AF, and hyperlipidemia are also highly prevalent in patients with HFpEF (S9.2.2-2,S9.2.2-11,S9.2.2-12) .H y p e r t e n s i o ni st h e most important cause of HFpEF, with a prevalence of 60% to 89% in large RCTs, epidemiological studies, and HF registries (S9.2.2-2,S9.2.2-13) . Patients with HF pEF also have an exaggerated hypertensive response to exercise (S9.2.2-14) . Hypertensive acute pulmonary edema is an expression of HFpEF (S9.2.2-15) . BP control is important for prevention of HF pEF in patients with hypertension (S9.2.2-2,S9.2.2-16 — S9.2.2-19) . ALLHAT showed that treatment of hypertension with chlorthalidone reduced the risk of HF compared with amlodipine, doxazosin, and lisinopril (S9.2.2-19,S9.2.2- 20). Improved BP control also reduces hospitalization, CVD events, and mortality (S9.2.2-2,S9.2.2-16 — S9.2.2-19) . Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Diuretics are the only drugs used for the treatment of hypertension and HF that can adequately control the ﬂuid retention of HF. Appropriate use of diuretics is also crucial to the success of other drugs used for the treatment of hypertension in the presence of HF. The use of inappropriately low doses of diuretics can result in ﬂuid retention. Conversely, the use of inappropri- ately high doses of diuretics can lead to volume contraction, which can increase the risk of hypotension and renal insufﬁciency. Diuretics should be prescribed to all patients with hypertension and HFpEF who have evidence of, and to most patients with a prior history of, ﬂuid retention. 2. In a trial of patients with HF pEF and MI, patients randomized to propranolol had at 32-month follow-up a 35% reduction in mortality rate (S9.2.2-3) .A f t e r 21 months of treatment in patients with HF rEF and HFpEF, compared with placebo, those randomized to nebivolol had a 14% reduction in mortality or CVD hospitalization if they had HFrEF and a 19% reduction if they had HFpEF (S9.2.2-4) . In patients with HFpEF, the primary outcome (a composite of CVD death or HF hospitalization) was observed in 22% for candesartan and 24% for placebo (11% reduction), but fewer patients receiving candesartan were hospitalized for HF (S9.2.2-5) . The use of nitrates in the setting of HFpEF is associated with a signal of harm and in most situations should be avoided. For many other common antihyper- tensive agents, including alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers, limited data exist to guide t h ec h o i c eo fa n t i h y p e r t e n s i v et h e r a p yi nt h es e t t i n g of HF pEF (S9.2.2-21) . Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition, however, with ACE inhibitor or ARB and especially MRA would represent the preferred choice.

MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e175 Synopsis Refer to the“Systematic Review for the 2017 ACC/AHA/ AAPA/ABC/ACPM/AGS/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA Guide- line for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults ” for the complete systematic evidence review for additional data and analyses (S9.3-13). Hypertension is the most common comorbidity affecting patients with CKD. Hypertension has been reported in 67% to 92% of patients with CKD, with increasing prevalence as kidney function declines(S9.3-14). Hypertension may occur as a result of kidney disease, yet the presence of hypertension may also accelerate further kidney injury; therefore, treatment is an important means to prevent further kidney functional decline. This tight inter- action has led to extensive debate about the optimal BP target for patients with CKD(S9.3-15— S9.3-18). Masked hy- pertension may occur in up to 30% of patients with CKD and portends higher risk of CKD progression(S9.3-19— S9.3-23). CKD is an important risk factor for CVD(S9.3-24), and the coexistence of hypertension and CKD further increases the risk of adverse CVD and cerebrovascular events, particularly when proteinuria is present (S9.3-25). Even as the impor- tance of hypertension treatment is widely accepted, data supporting BP targets in CKD are limited, as patients with CKD were historically excluded from clinical trials. Furthermore, CKD is not included in the CVD risk calcula- tions used to determine suitability for most clinical trials (S9.3-26— S9.3-28). Until publication of the SPRINT results, most guide- l i n e sf o rB Pt a r g e t si np a t i e n t sw i t hC K Df a v o r e dt r e a t - ment to a BP<140/90 mm Hg(S9.3-15) , with consideration of the lower target of <130/80 mm Hg for those with more severe proteinuria ( $300 mg albuminuria in 24 hours or the equivalent), if tolerated(S9.3-16 — S9.3-18) . Patients with stage 3 to 4 CKD (eGFR of 20 to<60 mL/ minute/1.73 m 2) comprised 28% of the SPRINT study population, and in this group intensive BP management seemed to provide the same beneﬁts for reduction in the CVD composite primary outcome and all-cause mortality as were seen in the full study cohort. Given that most patients with CKD die from CVD complications, this RCT evidence supports a lower target of<130/80 mm Hg for all patients with CKD ( Figure 6 ). It is appropriate to acknowledge that many patients with CKD have addi- tional comorbidities and evidence of frailty that caused them to be excluded from past clinical trials. Observa- t i o n a ls t u d i e so fC K Dc o h o r t si n d i c a t eah i g h e rr i s ko f mortality at lower systolic pressures and a ﬂat relation- ship of SBP to event risk in elderly patients with CKD (S9.3-29,S9.3-30) , which supports concerns that these complex patients may be at greater risk of complications from intensive BP treatment and may fail to achieve beneﬁts from lower BP targets. In contrast, in the pre- speci ﬁed subgroup analysis of the elderly cohort in SPRINT, frail elderly patients did sustain beneﬁtf r o mt h e lower BP target, which supports a lower goal for all patients, including those with CKD (S9.3-31) .I nt h i s setting, incremental BP red uction may be appropriate, with careful monitoring of physical and kidney function. An ACE inhibitor (or an ARB, in case of ACE inhibitor intolerance) is a preferred drug for treatment of hyper- tension if albuminuria ( $300 mg/day or $300 mg/g creatinine by ﬁrst morning void) is present, although the evidence is mixed (S9.3-10,S9.3-11) (Figure 6 ). In the course of reducing intraglome rular pressure and thereby reducing albuminuria, serum creatinine may increase up to 30% because of concurrent reduction in GFR(S9.3-32) . Further GFR decline should be investigated and may be related to other factors, incl uding volume contraction, use of nephrotoxic agents, or renovascular disease (S9.3- 33). The combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB should be avoided because of reported harms demon- strated in several large cardiology trials (S9.3-34,S9.3-35) and in 1 diabetic nephropathy trial (S9.3-36) .B e c a u s eo f the greater risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension and lack FIGURE 6 Management of Hypertension in Patients With CKD Colors correspond to Class of Recommendation inTable 1. *CKD stage 3 or higher or stage 1 or 2 with albuminuria$300 mg/d or$300 mg/g creatinine.

Figure 6 is an algorithm on management of hyperten- sion in patients with CKD. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. We recommend ASCVD risk assessment in all adults with hypertension, including those with CKD. As a matter of convenience, however, it can be assumed that the vast majority of patients with CKD have a 10-year ASCVD risk $10%, placing them in the high risk category that requires initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy at BP $130/80 mm Hg (see Section 8.1.2 , Figure 4 and Table 23 for BP thresholds for initiating antihypertensive drug treatment). In SPRINT, the par- ticipants with CKD who were randomized to intensive antihypertensive therapy (SBP target <120 mm Hg) appeared to derive the same bene ﬁcial reduction in CVD events and all-cause mortality that was seen in their counterparts without CKD at baseline. Likewise, intensive therapy was bene ﬁcial even in those $75 years of age with frailty or the slowest gait speed. There was no difference in the principal kidney outcome ($50% decline in eGFR or ESRD) between the intensive-and standard-therapy (SBP target <140 mm Hg) groups (S9.3-26) . Three other RCTs (S9.3-1 — S9.3-3) have evaluated the effect of differing BP goals of <140/90 mm Hg versus 125 –130/75 –80 mm Hg on CKD progression in patients with CKD. None of these trials demonstrated a bene ﬁt for more intensive BP reduction, although post hoc follow-up analyses favored the lower targets in patients with more severe proteinuria (S9.3-38,S9.3-39) , and these trials were underpowered to detect differences in CVD event rates. Recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews that included patients with CKD from SPRINT support more intensive BP treatment (S9.3-40 — S9.3-42) to reduce cardiovascular events but do not demonstrate a reduction in the rate of progression of kidney disease (doubling of serum creatinine or reaching ESRD). More intensive BP treatment may result in a modest reduc- tion in GFR, which is thought to be primarily due to a hemodynamic effect and may be reversible. Electrolyte abnormalities are also more likely during intensive BP treatment. More intensive BP lowering in patients with CKD is also supported by a BP Lowering Treatment Trialists ’ Collaboration meta-analysis of RCTs in pa- tients with CKD (S9.3-43) . 2. Evidence comes from AASK (The African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension), 2 small trials (1 positive, 1 negative), and a meta-analysis (S9.3-3,S9.3-6,S9.3-10,S9.3-11) . Albuminuria is quanti- ﬁed by 24-hour urine collection. A 10% to 25% increase in serum creatinine may occur in some patients with CKD as a result of ACE inhibitor therapy. 3. ARBs were shown to be noninferior to ACE inhibitors in clinical trials in the non-CKD population (S9.3-35) .A 10% to 25% increase in serum creatinine may occur in some patients with CKD as a result of ARB therapy. 9.3.1. Hypertension After Renal Transplantation Recommendations for Treatment of Hypertension After Renal Transplantation References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 39 and 40.

After kidney transplantation, it is reasonable to treat patients with hypertension with a calcium antagonist on the basis of improved GFR and kidney survival(S9.3.1-2) . Synopsis After kidney transplantation, hypertension is common because of preexisting kidney disease, the effects of immunosuppressive medications, and the presence of allograft pathology (S9.3.1-3) . Transplant recipients frequently harbor multiple CVD risk factors and are at high risk of CVD events. Hypertension may accelerate target organ damage and kidney function decline, particularly when proteinuria is present (S9.3.1-4 — S9.3.1-6) . Use of calcineurin inhibitor–based immunosuppression regimens after transplantation is associated with a high (70% to 90%) prevalence of hypertension (S9.3.1-7) . JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e177 Hypertension is less common when calcineurin inhibitors have been used without corticosteroids in liver trans- plantation patients (S9.3.1-8) , although prevalence rates have not differed in steroid minimization trials after kidney transplantation (S9.3.1-9,S9.3.1-10) .R e p o r t sf r o m long-term belatacept-based immunosuppression studies indicate higher GFR and preservation of kidney function. However, hypertension was still present in the majority of patients, although fewer agents were needed to achieve BP goals (S9.3.1-11) . Severity of hypertension and in- tensity of treatment may differ somewhat depending on the type of organ transplanted; however, most concepts relevant to kidney transplant recipients will apply to the other solid organ recipients as well. BP targets change over time after transplantation. Initially, it is important to maintain ample organ perfu- sion with less stringent BP targets ( <160/90 mm Hg) to avoid hypotension and risk of graft thrombosis. Beyond the ﬁrst month, BP should be controlled to prevent target organ damage as in the nontransplantation setting(S9.3.1- 12,S9.3.1-13) . Hypertension after transplantation is often associated with altered circadian BP rhythm with loss of the normal nocturnal BP fall (S9.3.1-14,S9.3.1-15) and, in some, a nocturnal BP rise. These changes may return to normal after a longer period of follow-up(S9.3.1-16) . Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Although treatment targets for hypertension after transplantation should probably be similar to those for other patients with CKD, there are no trials in post- transplantation patients comparing different BP tar- gets. As kidney transplant recipients generally have a single functioning kidney and CKD, BP targets should be similar to those for the general CKD population. 2. Limited studies have compared drug choice for initial antihypertensive therapy in patients after kidney transplantation. On the basis of a Cochrane analysis (S9.3.1-2) , most studies favor CCBs to reduce graft loss and maintain higher GFR, with some evidence sug- gesting potential harm from ACE inhibitors because of anemia, hyperkalemia, and lower GFR. In recognition of this concern, RAS inhibitors may be reserved for the subset of patients with hypertension and additional comorbidities that support the need for ACE inhibitor therapy (i.e., proteinuria or HF after transplantation). With appropriate potassium and creatinine monitoring, this has been demonstrated to be safe(S9.3.1-17) . 9.4. Cerebrovascular Disease Stroke is a leading cause of death, disability, and de- mentia (S9.4-1) . Because of its heterogeneous causes and hemodynamic consequences, the management of BP in adults with stroke is complex and challenging(S9.4-2) .T o accommodate the variety of important issues pertaining to BP management in the stroke patient, treatment rec- ommendations require recognition of stroke acuity, stroke type, and therapeutic objectives. Future studies should target more narrowly de ﬁned questions, such as optimal BP-reduction timing and target, as well as ideal antihypertensive agent therapeutic class by patient type and event type. 9.4.1.

A secondary endpoint in 1 RCT and an overview of data from 4 RCTs indicate that intensive BP reduction, versus BP-lowering guideline treatment, is associated with greater functional recovery at 3 months (S9.4.1-1,S9.4.1-7) . 2. RCT data have suggested that immediate BP lowering (to <140/90 mm Hg) within 6 hours of an acute ICH was feasible and safe (S9.4.1-1,S9.4.1-8,S9.4.1-9) ,m a yb e linked to greater attenuati on of absolute hematoma growth at 24 hours(S9.4.1-7) ,a n dm i g h tb ea s s o c i a t e d with modestly better functi onal recovery in survivors (S9.4.1-1,S9.4.1-7) .H o w e v e r ,ar e c e n tR C T(S9.4.1-2) that examined immediate BP lowering within 4.5 hours of an acute ICH found that treatment to achieve a target SBP of 110 to 139 mm Hg did not lead to a lower rate of death or disability than standard reduction to a target of 140 to 179 mm Hg. Moreover, there were signi ﬁcantly more renal adverse events within 7 days after randomization in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (S9.4.1-2) .P u t together, neither of the 2 key trials (S9.4.1-1,S9.4.1-2) evaluating the effect of lowering SBP in the acute period after spontaneous ICH met their primary out- comes of reducing death and severe disability at 3 months.

Acute Ischemic Stroke Synopsis Elevated BP is common during acute ischemic stroke (occurring in up to 80% of patients), especially among patients with a history of hypertension (S9.4.2-10) . However, BP often decreases spontaneously during the acute phase of ischemic stroke, as soon as 90 minutes after the onset of symptoms. Countervailing theoretical concerns about arterial hypertension during acute ischemic stroke include aiming to enhance cerebral perfusion of the ischemic tissue while minimizing the exacerbation of brain edema and hemorrhagic trans- formation of the ischemic tissue (S9.4.2-11,S9.4.2-12) . Some studies have shown a U-shaped relationship between the admission BP an d favorable clinical out- comes, with an optimal SBP and DBP ranging from 121 to 200 mm Hg and 81 to 110 mm Hg, respectively (S9.4.2-13) . It is conceivable that an optimal arterial BP range exists during acute ischemic stroke on an indi- vidual basis, contingent on the ischemic stroke subtype and other patient-speci ﬁc comorbidities. Early initiation or resumption of antihypertensive treatment after acute ischemic stroke is indicated only in speci ﬁcs i t u a t i o n s : 1) patients treated with tissue-type plasminogen acti- vator (S9.4.2-1,S9.4.2-2) , and 2) patients with SBP >220 mm Hg or DBP >120 mm Hg. For the latter group, it should be kept in mind that ce rebral autoregulation in the ischemic penumbra of the stroke is grossly abnormal and that systemic perfusion pressure is needed for blood ﬂow and oxygen delivery. Rapid reduction of BP, even to lower levels within the hypertensive range, can be detrimental. For all other acute ischemic stroke patients, the advantage of lowering BP early to reduce death and dependency is uncertain (S9.4.2-4 — S9.4.2-9) , but restarting antihypertensive therapy to improve long-term BP control is reasonable after the ﬁrst 24 hours for patients who have preexisting hypertension and are neurologically stable (S9.4.2- 4,S9.4.2-5,S9.4.2-14) . Recommendations for Management of Hypertens ion in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 42 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS I B-NR 1. Adults with acute ischemic stroke and elevated BP who are eligible for treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator should have their BP slowly lowered to less than 185/110 mm Hg before throm- bolytic therapy is initiated (S9.4.2-1,S9.4.2-2) . I B-NR 2. In adults with an acute ischemic stroke, BP shouldbe less than 185/110 mm Hg before administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and should be maintained below 180/105 mm Hg for at least the ﬁrst 24 hours after initiating drug therapy (S9.4.2-3) . IIa B-NR 3. Starting or restarting antihypertensive therapy dur ing hospitalization in patients with BP greater than 140/90 mm Hg who are neurologically stable is safe and reasonable to improve long-term BP control, unless contraindicated (S9.4.2-4,S9.4.2-5) . IIb C-EO 4. In patients with BP of 220/120 mm Hg or higher who did not receive intravenous alteplase or endovascular treatment and have no comorbid conditions requiring acute antihypertensive treatment, the beneﬁto fi n i t i a t i n go rr e i n i t i a t i n gt r eatment of hypertension within the ﬁrst 48 to 72 hours is uncertain. It might be reasonable to lower BP by 15% during theﬁrst 24 hours after onset of stroke. III: No BeneﬁtA 5. In patients with BP less than 220/120 mm Hg who did not receive intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment and do not have a comorbid condition requiring acute antihypertensive treatment, initiating or reinitiating treatment of hypertension within the ﬁrst 48 to 72 hours after an acute ischemic stroke is not effecti v et op r e v e n td e a t ho rd e p e n d e n c y(S9.4.2-4 — S9.4.2-9) .

Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. These BP cutoffs correspond to study inclusion criteria in pivotal clinical trials of intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke (S9.4.2-1) . 2. In a large observational study of patients with acute ischemic stroke who received intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator, high BP during the initial 24 hours was linked to greater risk of symptomatic ICH (S9.4.2-3) . 3. For the goal of antihypertensive therapy, seeSection 8.1.5. 4. Extreme arterial hypertension is detrimental because it can lead to encephalopathy, cardiac compromise, and renal damage. However, hypotension, especially when too rapidly achieved, is potentially harmful because it abruptly reduces perfusion to multiple organs, including the brain. 5. Data from 2 RCTs (S9.4.2-5,S9.4.2-9) ,a sw e l la ss y s - tematic reviews and meta-analyses (S9.4.2-6 — S9.4.2- 8), indicate that antihypertensive agents reduce BP d u r i n gt h ea c u t ep h a s eo fa ni s c h e m i cs t r o k eb u td on o t confer beneﬁt with regard to short- and long-term de- pendency and mortality rate.

Secondary Stroke Prevention Synopsis Each year in the United States, >750,000 adult patients experience a stroke, of which up to 25% are recurrent strokes (S9.4.3-10) . For an individual who experiences an initial stroke or TIA, the annual risk of a subsequent or “secondary ” stroke is approximately 4% (S9.4.3-11) , and the case mortality rate is 41% after a recurrent stroke versus 22% after an initial stroke (S9.4.3-12) . Among patients with a recent stroke or TIA, the prevalence of premorbid hypertension is approxi- mately 70% (S9.4.3-13) . Risk of recurrent stroke is heightened by presence of el evated BP, and guideline- recommended antihypertens ive drug treatment to lower BP has been linked to a reduction in 1-year recurrent stroke risk (S9.4.3-14) . RCT meta-analyses show an approximately 30% decrease in recurrent stroke risk with BP-lowering therapies (S9.4.3-1 — S9.4.3-3) .A ni s s u e frequently raised by clinicians is whether the presence of clinically asymptomatic cerebral infarction incidentally noted on brain imaging (computed tomography or MRI scan) in patients without a history of or symptoms of a stroke or TIA warrants implementation of secondary stroke prevention measures. Clinically asymptomatic vascular brain injury is increasingly being considered as an entry point for secondary stroke prevention therapies, because these apparently “silent ” brain infarctions are associated with typical stroke risk factors, accumulatively lead to subtle neurological impairments, and bolster risk of future symptomatic stroke events (S9.4.3-15) . Although the evidence for using antihypertensive treat- ment to prevent recurrent stroke in stroke patients with elevated BP is compelling (S9.4.3-1 — S9.4.3-3) , questions remain about when precisely after an index stroke to initiate it, what speci ﬁc agent(s) to use (if any), which therapeutic targets to aim for, and whether the treatment approach should vary by index stroke mechanism and baseline level of BP (S9.4.3-16) . Figure 9 is an algorithm on management of hyperten- sion in patients with a previous history of stroke (sec- ondary stroke prevention). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Two overviews of RCTs published through 2009 showed that antihypertensive medications lowered the risk of recurrent vascular events in patients with stroke or TIA (S9.4.3-1 — S9.4.3-3) . Recommendations for Treatment of Hypertension for Secondary Stroke Prevention References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 43 and 44. COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS IA 1. Adults with previously treated hypertension who experience a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) should be restarted on antihypertensive treatment after the ﬁrst few days of the index event to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and other vascular events (S9.4.3-1 — S9.4.3-3) . IA 2. For adults who experience a stroke or TIA, treatment with a thiazide diuretic, ACE inhibitor, or ARB, or combination treatment consisting of a thiazide diuretic plus ACE inhibitor, is useful (S9.4.3-1,S9.4.3-3 — S9.4.3-5) . I B-R 3. Adults not previously treated for hypertension who experience a stroke or TIA and have an established BP of 140/90 mm Hg or higher should be prescribed antihypertensive treatment a few days after the index event to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and other vascular events(S9.4.3-1 — S9.4.3-3) . I B-NR 4. For adults who experience a stroke or TIA, selection of speciﬁc drugs should be individualized on the basis of patient comorbidities and agent pharmacological class (S9.4.3-6) . IIb B-R 5. For adults who experience a stroke or TIA, a BP goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg may be reasonable (S9.4.3-6,S9.4.3-7) . IIb B-R 6. For adults with a lacunar stroke, a target SBP goal of less than 130 mm Hg may be reasonable(S9.4.3-8) . IIb C-LD 7. In adults previously untreated for hypertension who experience an ischemic stroke or TIA and have a SBP less than 140 mm Hg and a DBP less than 90 mm Hg, theusefulness of initiating antihypertensive treatment is not well established (S9.4.3-9) .

Reduction in BP appears to be more important than the choice of speci ﬁc agents used to achieve this goal. Thus, if diuretic and ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment do not achieve BP target, other agents, such as CCB and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, may be added. 5. An overview of RCTs showed that larger reductions in S B Pt e n d e dt ob ea s s o c i a t e dw i t hg r e a t e rr e d u c t i o ni n risk of recurrent stroke. However, a separate overview of RCTs in patients who experienced a stroke noted that achieving an SBP level <130 mm Hg was not associated with a lower stroke risk, and several obser- vational studies did not show bene ﬁtw i t ha c h i e v e d SBP levels <120 mm Hg(S9.4.3-5) . 6.

No published RCTs have speci ﬁcally addressed this question, but a post hoc analysis of an RCT suggests that the effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment for secondary stroke prevention diminishes as initial baseline BP declines (S9.4.3-9) .

Hypertension is a major risk factor for PAD, so these patients are commonly enrolled in trials of antihy- pertensive drug therapy. However, patients with PAD typically comprise a small fraction of participants, so in the few trials that report results in patients with PAD, subgroup analyses are generally underpowered.

In adults with DM and hypertension, allﬁrst-line classes of antihyperte nsive agents (i.e., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs) are useful and effective (S9.6-1,S9.6-9,S9.6-10) . IIb B-NR 3. In adults with DM and hypertension, ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be considered in the presence of albuminuria (S9.6-11,S9.6-12) . SR indicates systematic review.

The prevalence of hypertension among adults with DM is approximately 80%, and hypertension is at least twice as common in persons with type 2 DM than in age-matched individuals without DM (S9.6-14 — S9.6-16) . The coexistence of hypertension and DM markedly increases the risk of developing CVD dam- age, resulting in a higher incidence of CHD, HF, PAD, stroke, and CVD mortality(S9.6-17) ,a n dm a yi n c r e a s er i s k of microvascular disease, such as nephropathy or reti- nopathy (S9.6-16,S9.6-18) . Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e184 There is limited quality evidence to determine a precise BP target in adults with DM. No RCTs have explicitly 1) documented whether treatment to an SBP goal <140 mm Hg versus a higher goal improves clinical outcomes in adults with hypertension and DM or 2) directly evaluated clinical outcomes associated with SBP <130 mm Hg (S9.6-2) . However, 2 high-quality systematic reviews of RCTs support an SBP target of<140 mm Hg(S9.6-4,S9.6-7) . There is little or no available RCT evidence supporting as p e c iﬁc DBP threshold for initiation of pharmacological therapy. Several RCTs, including the HOT (Hypertension Optimal Treatment) trial, UKPDS (United Kingdom Pro- spective Diabetes Study), and ABCD (Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes) trial (S9.6-19 — S9.6-22) ,a r e often cited to support a lower DBP target (e.g.,#85 or 80 mm Hg) for adults with hypertension and DM. However, these trials were conducted when the diagnostic criteria for DM were more conservative than they are currently (2 fasting glucose levels >140 mg/dL as opposed to 126 mm/dL today). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. We recommend ASCVD risk assessment in all adults with hypertension, including adults with DM. As a matter of convenience, however, it can be assumed that the vast majority of adults with DM have a 10-year ASCVD risk $ 10%, placing them in the high risk cate- gory that requires initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy at BP $ 130/80 mm Hg (see Section 8.1.2 , Figure 4 and Table 23 for BP thresholds for initiating antihypertensive drug treatment). The ACCORD trial (S9.6-5) , which compared CVD outcomes in adults with DM and hypertension who were randomized to an SBP target of <140 mm Hg (standard therapy) or <120 mm Hg (intensive therapy), did not document a signi ﬁcant reduction in the primary outcome (CVD composite) with the lower BP goal, but the trial was underpowered to detect a statistically signi ﬁcant dif- ference between the 2 treatment arms. The ACCORD trial demonstrated a small reduction in absolute risk (1.1%) for stroke, but there were few such events. More adverse events (2% increase in absolute risk) were identi ﬁed in the lower BP group, especially self- reported hypotension and a reduction in estimated GFR, but these did not result in an excess of stroke or ESRD. The ACCORD trial was a factorial study; sec- ondary analysis demonstrated a signi ﬁcant outcome beneﬁt in the intensive BP/standard glycemic group (S9.6-3) , but beneﬁt in the intensive BP/intensive gly- cemic control group was no better than in the intensive BP/standard glycemic control group, which suggests a ﬂoor bene ﬁt beyond which the combined intensive interventions were ineffective (S9.6-5) .A nA C C O R D secondary analysis suggested that an SBP<120 mm Hg is superior to standard BP control in reducing LVH (S9.6-6) . A meta-analysis of 73,913 patients with DM reported that an SBP<130 mm Hg reduced stroke by 39%. How- ever, there was no signiﬁcant risk reduction for MI(S9.6- 23). Two meta-analyses addressing target BP in adults with DM restricted the analysis to RCTs that randomized patients to different BP levels(S9.6-4,S9.6-7). Target BP of 133/76 mm Hg provided signiﬁcant beneﬁt compared with that of 140/81 mm Hg for major cardiovascular events, MI, stroke, albuminuria, and retinopathy progression(S9.6-4). Several meta-analyses of RCTs included all trials with a difference in BP (S9.6-24,S9.6-25), but 2 restricted their analyses to trials in which participants were randomized to different BP target levels(S9.6-4,S9.6-7). SPRINT demonstrated cardiovascular bene ﬁt from intensive treatment of BP to a goal of<120 mm Hg as compared with<140 mm Hg but did not include patients with DM. However, the results of ACCORD and SPRINT were generally consistent(S9.6-26). In addition, a SPRINT substudy demonstrated that patients with prediabetes derived a beneﬁt similar to that of patients with normo- glycemia (S9.6-8). Previous trials have shown similar quantitative beneﬁts from lowering BP in persons with and without DM(S9.6-9). 2. BP control is more difﬁcult to achieve in patients with DM than in those without DM, necessitating use of combination therapy in the majority of patients (S9.6- 27). All major antihypertensive drug classes (i.e., ACE i n h i b i t o r s ,A R B s ,C C B s ,a n dd i u r e t i c s )a r eu s e f u li nt h e treatment of hypertension in DM (S9.6-1,S9.6-9) . However, in ALLHAT, doxazosin was clearly inferior to chlorthalidone, which also reduced some events more than amlodipine or lisinopril (S9.6-28) . 3. ACE inhibitors and ARBs have the best efﬁcacy among the drug classes on urinary albumin excretion(S9.6-12) (see Section 9.3 ). Therefore, an ACE inhibitor or ARB may be considered as part of the combination. A meta- analysis of RCTs of primary prevention of albuminuria in patients with DM demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduc- tion in progression of moderately to severely increased albuminuria with the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs (S9.6-11) . 9.7. Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is a state of metabolic dysregulation characterized by visceral fat accumulation, insulin resis- tance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia, as well as predisposition to type 2 DM, hypertension, and athero- sclerotic CVD (S9.7-1 — S9.7-3) . According to data from the NHANES III and NHANES 1999 –2006 (S9.7-1,S9.7-4) ,t h e prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the United States JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e185 was 34.2% in 2006 and has likely increased substantially since that time. The metabolic syndrome is linked to several other disorders, including nonalcoholic steatohe- patitis, polycystic ovary syndrome, certain cancers, CKD, Alzheimer ’sd i s e a s e ,C u s h i n g’s syndrome, lipodystrophy, and hyperalimentation (S9.7-5,S9.7-6) . Lifestyle modiﬁcation, with an emphasis on improving insulin sensitivity by means of dietary modi ﬁcation, weight reduction, and exercise, is the foundation of treatment of the metabolic syndrome. The optimal anti- hypertensive drug therapy for patients with hypertension in the setting of the metabolic syndrome has not been clearly deﬁned (S9.7-1) . Although caution exists with re- gard to the use of thiazide diuretics in this population because of their ability to increase insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hyperuricemia and to accelerate con- version to overt DM, no data are currently available demonstrating deterioration in cardiovascular or renal outcomes in patients treated with these agents (S9.7-1) . Indeed, as shown in follow-up of ALLHAT, chlorthalidone use was associated with only a small increase in fasting glucose levels (1.5 –4 . 0m g / d L ) ,a n dt h i si n c r e a s ed i dn o t translate into increased CVD risk at a later date(S9.7-7 — S9.7-10) . In addition, in post hoc analysis of the nearly two thirds of participants in ALLHAT that met criteria for the metabolic syndrome, chlorthalidone was unsurpassed in reducing CVD and renal outcomes compared with lisi- nopril, amlodipine, or doxazosin (S9.7-9,S9.7-11) .S i m i - larly, high-dose ARB therapy reduces arterial stiffness in patients with hypertension with the metabolic syndrome, but no outcomes data are available from patients in which this form of treatment was used (S9.7-12) .U s eo ft r a d i - tional beta blockers may lead to dyslipidemia or deterio- ration of glucose tolerance, and ability to lose weight (S9.7-2) . In several large clinical trials, the risk of devel- oping DM as a result of traditional beta-blocker therapy was 15% to 29%(S9.7-2) .H o w e v e r ,t h en e w e rv a s o d i l a t i n g beta blockers (e.g., labetalol, carvedilol, nebivolol) have shown neutral or favorable effects on metabolic pro ﬁles c o m p a r e dw i t ht h et r a d i t i o n a lb e t ab l o c k e r s(S9.7-13) . Trials using vasodilator beta blockers have not been performed to demonstrate effects on CVD outcomes. 9.8. Atrial Fibrillation Recommendation for Treatment of Hypertension in Patients With AF References that support the recommendation are summarized in Online Data Supplement 48 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION IIa B-R 1. Treatment of hypertension with an ARB can be useful for prevention of recurrence of AF(S9.8-1,S9.8-2) . Synopsis AF and hypertension are common and often coexistent conditions, both of which increase in frequency with age. AF occurs in 3% to 4% of the population>65 years of age (S9.8-3) . Hypertension is present in>80% of patients with AF and is by far the most common comorbid condition, regardless of age (S9.8-4) .A Fi sa s s o c i a t e dw i t hs y s t e m i c thromboembolism, as reco gnized in the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scoring systems for stroke risk (S9.8-5) .I t is also associated with gradua l worsening of ventricular function, the subsequent development of HF, and increased mortality. Hypertension has long been recognized as a risk factor for AF because it is associated with LVH, decreased dia- stolic function with impaired LV ﬁlling, rising left atrial pressures with left atrial hypertrophy and enlargement, increased atrial ﬁbrosis, and slowing of intra-atrial and interatrial electrical conduction velocities. Such a distor- tion of atrial anatomy and physiology increases the inci- dence of AF (S9.8-6) .L e f ta t r i a lp r e s s u r ea l s oi n c r e a s e s with ischemic or valvular heart disease and myopathies that are often associated with systemic hypertension, potentially leading to AF. Although management of AF will continue to revolve around restoration of sinus rhythm when appropriate, rate control when it is not, and anticoagulation, control of hypertension is a key component of therapy (S9.8- 1,S9.8-2) . Treatment of hypertension may prevent new-onset AF, especially in patients with LVH or LV dysfunction(S9.8-1) . Five RCTs have compared the value of antihypertensive agents for reduction of new-onset AF (S9.8-7 — S9.8-11) . One study suggested superiority of RAS blockade over a CCB (S9.8-8) , and another reported superiority of RAS blockade over a beta blocker that is no longer recom- mended for treatment of hypertension (S9.8-9) .I nt h e largest trial, there was no difference in incident AF among adults with hypertension assigned to ﬁrst-step therapy with a diuretic, ACE inhibitor, or CCB (S9.8-10) .I nA L L - HAT, the incidence of AF was 23% higher duringﬁrst-step Whelton et al.

Furthermore, the occurrence of AF or atrialﬂutter during the study, either new onset or recurrent, was associated with an increase in mortality of nearly 2.5-fold (S9.8-10) . Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Although RAS blockade in theory is the treatment of choice for hypertension in patients with prior AF, relative to other classes of agents, all of the trials that have shown clinical superiority of ARBs over other agents were comparisons with CCBs or beta blockers that are no longer recommended asﬁrst-line agents for treatment of hypertension (S9.8-2) .T h e r ea r en o available trials comparing ACE inhibitors with other drugs or any RAS-blocking agents with diuretics. 9.9. Valvular Heart Disease Recommendations for Treatment of Hypertension in Patients With Valvular Heart Disease References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 49 and 50. COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS I B-NR 1. In adults with asymptomatic aortic stenosis, hypertension should be treated with pharmacotherapy, starting at a low dose and gradually titrating upward as needed(S9.9-1 — S9.9-4) . IIa C-LD 2. In patients with chronic aortic insufﬁciency, treatment of systolic hypertension with agents that do not slow the heart rate (i.e., avoid beta blockers) is reasonable (S9.9-5,S9.9-6) . Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Hypertension is a risk factor for the development of aortic stenosis (stage A [e.g., aortic sclerosis or bicuspid aortic valve]) and asymptomatic aortic stenosis (stage B [progressive asymptomatic aortic stenosis]). The combination of hypertension and aortic stenosis, “2 resistors in series, ” increases the rate of complications. In patients with asymptomatic mild-to- moderate aortic stenosis, hypertension has been associated with more abnormal LV structure and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (S9.9-1) . There is no evidence that antihypertensive medications will produce an inordinate degree of hy- potension in patients with aortic stenosis. Nitroprus- side infusion in hypertensive patients with severe aortic stenosis lowers pulmonary and systemic resis- tance, with improvements in stroke volume and LV end-diastolic pressure (S9.9-2) .T h u s ,c a r e f u lu s eo f antihypertensive agents to achieve BP control in patients with hypertension and aortic stenosis is beneﬁcial. Although there are no speci ﬁct r i a l s comparing various classes o f antihypertensive agents, RAS blockade may be advantageous because of the potentially bene ﬁcial effects on LV ﬁbrosis (S9.9-3) , control of hypertension, reduction of dyspnea, and improved effort tolerance (S9.9-4) . Diuretics should be used sparingly in patients with small LV chamber dimensions. Beta blockers may be appropriate for patients with aortic stenosis who have reduced ejec- tion fraction, prior MI, arrhythmias, or angina pectoris. In patients with moderate or severe aortic stenosis, consultation or co-management with a cardiologist is preferred for hypertension management. 2. Vasodilator therapy can reduce the LV volume and mass and improve LV performance in patients with aortic regurgitation (S9.9-5) , but improvement of long-term clinical outcomes, such as time to valve replacement, have been variable (S9.9-5,S9.9-6) . Beta blockers may result in increased diastolic ﬁlling period because of bradycardia, potentially causing increased aortic insuf ﬁc i e n c y .M a r k e dr e d u c t i o ni nD B Pm a yl o w e r coronary perfusion pressure in patients with chronic severe aortic regurgitation (stage B [progressive asymptomatic aortic regurgitation] and stage C [asymptomatic severe AR]). However, there are no outcomes data to support these theoretical concerns. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e187 9.10. Aortic Disease Synopsis Thoracic aortic aneurysms are generally asymptomatic until a person presents with a sudden catastrophic event, such as an aortic dissection or rupture, which is rapidly fatal in the majority of patients (S9.10-3,S9.10-4) .T h e rationale for antihypertensi ve therapy is based largely on animal and observational studies associating hypertension with aortic dissection (S9.10-5,S9.10-6) .R C T ss p e c iﬁcally addressing hypertension and aortic disease are not avail- able, and trials in patients with primary hypertension do not provide insight on either the optimal BP target or choice of antihypertensive drug therapy in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, or aortic dis- ease (S9.10-7,S9.10-8) . A study in 20 humans with hyper- tension suggested that hypertension is associated with signi ﬁcant changes in the mechanical properties of the aortic wall, with more strain-induced stiffening in hyper- t e n s i o nt h a ni nn o r m o t e n s i o n ,w h i c hm a yr eﬂect destruction of elastin and predisposition to aortic dissec- t i o ni nt h ep r e s e n c eo fh y p e r t e n s i o n(S9.10-9) .I nar e t r o - spective observational study, high BP variability was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of aortic dissec- tion (S9.10-10) . Recommendations for treatment of acute aortic dissection are provided inSection 11.2. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. In patients with chronic aortic dissection, observational studies suggest lower risk for operative repair with beta-blocker therapy (S9.10-1) . In a series of patients with type A and type B aortic dissections, beta blockers were associated with improved survival in both groups, whereas ACE inhibitors did not improve survival (S9.10-2) . 10. SPECIAL PATIENT GROUPS Special attention is needed for speciﬁc patient subgroups. 10.1. Race and Ethnicity In the United States, at any decade of life, blacks have a higher prevalence of hypert ension than that of Hispanic Americans, whites, Native Americans, and other sub- groups de ﬁned by race and ethnicity (see Section 3.3 ). Hypertension control rates are lower for blacks, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans than for whites(S10.1-1) . Among men with hypertension, non-Hispanic white (53.8%) adults had a higher prevalence of controlled high blood pressure than did non-Hispanic black (43.8%), non- Hispanic Asian (39.9%), and Hispanic (43.5%) adults. For women with hypertension, the percentage of non- Hispanic white (59.1%) adults with controlled high blood pressure was higher than among non-Hispanic black (52.3%) and non-Hispanic Asian (46.8%) adults (S10.1-1) . In Hispanic Americans, the lower control rates result primarily from lack of awareness and treatment (S10.1- 2,S10.1-3) , whereas in blacks, awareness and treatment are at least as high as in whites, but hypertension is more severe and some agents are less effective at BP control (S10.1-4) . Morbidity and mortality attributed to hyper- tension are also more common in blacks and Hispanic Americans than in whites. Blacks have a 1.3-times greater risk of nonfatal stroke, 1.8-times greater risk of fatal strokes, 1.5-times greater risk of HF, and 4.2-times greater risk of ESRD (S10.1-4) . Hispanic Americans have lower rates of hypertension awareness and treatment than t h o s eo fw h i t e sa n db l a c k s ,a sw e l la sah i g hp r e v a l e n c eo f comorbid CVD risk factors (e.g., obesity, DM). In 2014, age-adjusted hypertension-attributable mortality rates per 1,000 persons for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic-American men and women were 19.3 and 15.8, 50.1 and 35.6, and 19.1 and 14.6, respectively (S10.1-5) . However, Hispanics in the United States are a heterogeneous subgroup, and rates of both hypertension and its consequences vary according to whether their ancestry is from the Caribbean, Mexico, Central or South America, or Europe (S10.1-6 — S10.1-8) .H i s p a n i c sf r o m Mexico and Central America have lower CVD rates than U.S. whites, whereas those of Caribbean origin have higher rates. Thus, pooling of data for Hispanics may not accurately re ﬂect risk in a given patient. Finally, the excess risk of CKD outcomes in at least some blacks with h y p e r t e n s i o nm a yb ed u et ot h ep r e s e n c eo fh i g h - r i s k APOL1 (apolipoprotein L1) genetic variants (S10.1-9 — S10.1-11) . The rate of renal decline associated with this genotype appears to be largely unresponsive to either BP lowering or RAS inhibition (S10.1-9 — S10.1-12) . Recommendation for Management of Hypertension in Patients With Aortic Disease COR LOE RECOMMENDATION I C-EO 1. Beta blockers are recommended as the preferred antihypertensive agents in patients with hypertension and thoracic aortic disease (S9.10-1,S9.10-2) . Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e188 10.1.1. Racial and Ethnic Differences in Treatment Synopsis Lifestyle modi ﬁcation (i.e., weight reduction, dietary modiﬁcation, and increased physical activity) is particu- larly important in blacks and Hispanic Americans for prevention and ﬁrst-line or adjunctive therapy of hyper- tension (see Sections 12.1.2 and 12.1.3 ). However, the adoption of lifestyle recommendations is often chal- lenging in ethnic minority patients because of poor social support, limited access to exercise opportunities and healthy foods, and ﬁnancial considerations. The greater prevalence of lower socioeconomic status may impede access to basic living necessities (S10.1.1-8) , including medical care and medications. Consideration must also be given to learning styles and preference, personal beliefs, values, and culture (S10.1.1-9,S10.1.1-10) . The principles of antihypertensive drug selection dis- cussed in Sections 8.1.4 through 8.1.6 apply to ethnic minorities with a few caveat s. In blacks, thiazide-type diuretics and CCBs are more effective in lowering BP when given as monotherapy or as initial agents in multi- drug regimens (S10.1.1-11 — S10.1.1-13) . In addition, thiazide-type agents are superior to drugs that inhibit the RAS (i.e., ACE inhibitors, ARBs, renin inhibitors, and beta blockers) for prevention of selected clinical outcomes in blacks (S10.1.1-2,S10.1.1-14 — S10.1.1-16) .F o ro p t i m u m endpoint protection, the thia zide chlorthalidone should be administered at a dose of 12.5 to 25 mg/day (or 25–50 mg/d for hydrochlorothiazide) because lower doses are either unproven or less effective in clinical outcome trials (S10.1.1-2,S10.1.1-16) . The CCB amlodipine is as effective as chlorthalidone and more effective than the ACE in- hibitor lisinopril in reducing BP, CVD, and stroke events but less effective in preventing HF. Blacks have a greater risk of angioedema with ACE inhibitors (S10.1.1-2,S10.1.1- 3), and Asian Americans have a higher incidence of ACE inhibitor –induced cough (S10.1.1-17) .A C Ei n h i b i t o r sa n d ARBs are recommended more generally as components of multidrug antihypertensive regimens in blacks with CKD (see Section 9.3 ), with the addition of beta blockers in t h o s ew i t hH F( s e eSection 9.2 ). Beta blockers are rec- ommended for treatment of patients with CHD who have had a MI. Most patients with hypertension, especially blacks, require $2 antihypertensive medications to ach- ieve adequate BP control. A single-tablet combination that includes either a diuretic or a CCB may be particularly effective in achieving BP control in blacks. Racial and ethnic differences should not be the basis for excluding any class of antihypertensive agent in combination therapy. Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. In blacks, thiazide diuretics or CCBs are more effective in lowering BP than are RAS inhibitors or beta blockers and more effective in reducing CVD events than are RAS inhibitors or alpha blockers. RAS inhibitors are recommended in black patients with hypertension, DM, and nephropathy, but they offer no advantage over diuretics or CCBs in hypertensive patients with DM without nephropathy or HF. 2. Four drug classes (thiazide diuretic, CCB, ACE inhibi- tor, or ARB) lower BP and reduce cardiovascular or renal outcomes (S10.1.1-18 — S10.1.1-21) .T h u s ,e x c e p tf o r the combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, regimens containing a combination of these classes are reason- able to achieve the BP target (S10.1.1-16,S10.1.1-21) . Furthermore, the combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a CCB or thiazide diuretic produces similar BP lowering in blacks as in other racial or ethnic groups. For blacks who do not achieve control with 3 drugs, see resistant hypertension (see Section 11.1). 10.2. Sex-Related Issues The prevalence of hypertension is lower in women than in men until about theﬁfth decade but is higher later in life (S10.2-1) . Other than special recommendations for man- agement of hypertension during pregnancy, there is no evidence that the BP threshold for initiating drug treat- ment, the treatment target, the choice of initial Recommendations for Race and Ethnicity References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 51 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS I B-R 1.

Two or more antihypertensive medications are recommended to achieve a BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg in most adults with hypertension, especially in black adults with hypertension (S10.1.1-5 — S10.1.1-7) .

MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e189 antihypertensive medication, or the combination of medications for lowering BP differs for women versus men (S10.2-2,S10.2-3) . 10.2.1. Women A potential limitation of RCTs, including SPRINT, is that they are not speciﬁcally powered to determine the value of intensive SBP reduction in subgroups, including women in t h ec a s eo fS P R I N T .H o w e v e r ,i np r e s p e c iﬁed analyses, there was no evidence of an interaction between sex and treatment effect. Furthermore, no signi ﬁcant differences in CVD outcomes were observed between men and women in a large meta-analysis that included 31 RCTs with about 1 0 0 , 0 0 0m e na n d9 0 , 0 0 0w o m e nw i t hh y p e r t e n s i o n (S10.2.1-1) . Some have called for a SPRINT-like trial with sufﬁcient power to assess the e ffects of intensive SBP r e d u c t i o ni nw o m e n(S10.2.1-2) . In meta-analyses, there was no convincing evidence that different antihyperten- sive drug classes exerted sex-related differences in BP lowering or provided distinct CVD protection (S10.2.1-1) . Calcium antagonists offered slightly greater bene ﬁts for stroke prevention than did ACE inhibitors for women than for men, whereas calcium antagonists reduced all-cause deaths compared with placebo in men but not in women. However, these sex-related differences might have been due to chance because of the large number of statistical comparisons that were performed. The Heart Attack Trial and Hypertension Care Computing Project reported that beta blockers were associated with reduced mortality in m e nb u tn o ti nw o m e n ,b u tt h i sﬁnding was likely due to the low event rates in women(S10.2.1-3) . Similarly, in the open-label Second Australian National BP study, a signif- icant reduction in CVD events was demonstrated in men but not in women with ACE inhibitors versus diuretics (S10.2.1-4) . Adverse effects of antihypertensive therapy were n o t e dt w i c ea so f t e ni nw o m e na si nm e ni nt h eT O M H S study (S10.2.1-5) .

Pregnancy Recommendations for Treatment of Hypertension in Pregnancy References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 53 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS I C-LD 1. Women with hypertension who become pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant, should be transitioned to methyldopa, ni fedipine, and/or labetalol (S10.2.2-1) during pregnancy (S10.2.2-2 — S10.2.2-6) . III: Harm C-LD 2. Women with hypertension who become pregnant should not be treated with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or direct renin inhibitors (S10.2.2-4 — S10.2.2-6) . Synopsis BP usually declines during the ﬁrst trimester of preg- nancy and then slowly rises. Hypertension management during pregnancy includes 4 general areas: 1) the newly pregnant mother with existing hypertension; 2) incident hypertension; 3) preeclampsia (a dangerous form of hy- pertension with proteinuria that has the potential to result in serious adverse consequences for the mother [stroke, HF] and fetus [small for gestational age, premature birth]); and 4) severe hypertension, often in the setting of pre- eclampsia, requiring urgent treatment to prevent HF, stroke, and adverse fetal outcomes. Hypertension during pregnancy and preeclampsia are recognized as risk factors for future hypertension and CVD(S10.2.2-7 — S10.2.2-9) .B P management during pregnancy is complicated by the fact that many commonly used antihypertensive agents, including ACE inhibitors an d ARBs, are contraindicated during pregnancy because of potential harm to the fetus (S10.2.2-2,S10.2.2-3) . The goal of antihypertensive treat- ment during pregnancy includes prevention of severe hypertension and the possibility of prolonging gestation to allow the fetus more time to mature before delivery. There are 3 Cochrane database reviews of treatment for mild-to-moderate hypertension during pregnancy (S10.2.2-10 — S10.2.2-12) .W i t hr e g a r dt ot h et r e a t m e n to f mild-to-moderate hypertension (SBP of 140–169 or DBP of 90–109 mm Hg), antihypertensive treatment reduces the risk of progression to severe hypertension by 50% compared with placebo but has not been shown to prevent preeclampsia, preterm birth, small for gestational age, or infant mortality. Beta blockers and CCBs appear superior to alpha-methyldopa in preventing Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e190 preeclampsia (S10.2.2-10) . An earlier review of 2 small trials did not show improved outcomes with more comprehensive treatment of BP to a target of <130/80 mm Hg (S10.2.2-11) . Consistent with the results of the Cochrane reviews, a large multinational RCT of treatment in pregnant women with mild-to-moderate hypertension also reported that treatment prevented progression to severe hypertension, but other maternal and infant out- comes were unaffected by the intensity of treatment (S10.2.2-13) . An earlier review conﬁned to assessing the effect of beta blockers found them generally safe and effective but of no beneﬁt for newborn outcomes, either in placebo-controlled studies or when compared with other antihypertensive agents. There was a suggestion that beta-blocker therapy might be associated with small for gestational age and neonatal bradycardia (S10.2.2-12) . The largest experience for beta blockers is with labetalol; the largest experience for CCBs is with nifedipine. Meth- yldopa and hydralazine may also be used. A review of treatment for pregnancy-asso ciated severe hypertension found insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend speci ﬁc agents; rather, clinician experience was recommended in this setting (S10.2.2-14) . Preeclampsia is a potentially dangerous condition for the pregnant woman and fetus, occurring in 3.8% of pregnancies, and preeclampsia and eclampsia account for 9% of maternal deaths in the United States (S10.2.2-15) . Preeclampsia is associated with an increased risk of pre- term delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, placental abruption, and perinatal mortality and is twice as likely to occur in theﬁrst pregnancy. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has recommended screening all pregnant women for preeclampsia by measuring BP at every pre- natal visit (S10.2.2-16) . It is beyond the scope of the present guideline to address the management of hypertension during preg- nancy in detail. Several international guidelines provide guidance on management of hypertension during preg- nancy (S10.2.2-2,S10.2.2-3,S10.2.2-17) . The American Col- lege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has issued a task force report that includes recommendations for preven- tion (aspirin in selected cases) and treatment (magnesium for severe hypertension) of hypertension in pregnancy (S10.2.2-2) . A report detailing treatment of hypertensive emergencies during pregnancy and postpartum has also been released (S10.2.2-2,S10.2.2-17,S10.2.2-18) . Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not approved for use during pregnancy; they are fetotoxic. Among the agents recommended, no speci ﬁca g e n ti sﬁrst choice because there are no data supporting one over another. Therapeutic classes are not recommended because potential toxicity differs among agents within classes. 2. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are fetotoxic in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Adverse effects in the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy may be secondary to hypertension or the medication (S10.2.2-4,S10.2.2-5) . Adverse events in the later trimesters have been sug- gested by observational data and meta-analyses (S10.2.2-6) . For ARBs, case reports with effects similar to ACE inhibitors have been published(S10.2.2-19) . 10.3. Age-Related Issues 10.3.1. Older Persons Recommendations for Treatment of Hypertension in Older Persons References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 54 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS IA 1. Treatment of hypertension with a SBP treatment goal of less than 130 mm Hg is recommended for noninstitutionalized ambulator y community-dwelling adults ( ‡6 5y e a r so fa g e )w i t ha na v e r a g eS B Po f 130 mm Hg or higher(S10.3.1-1) . IIa C-EO 2. For older adults (‡65 years of age) with hypertension and a high burden of comorbidity and limited life expectancy, clinical judgment, patient preferenc e, and a team-based approach to assess risk/beneﬁti s reasonable for decisions regarding intensity of BP lowering and choice of antihypertensive drugs. Synopsis Because of its extremely high prevalence in older adults, hypertension is not only a leading cause of pre- ventable morbidity and mortality but, perhaps more importantly, is under-recogn ized as a major contributor to premature disability and institutionalization (S10.3.1-2 — S10.3.1-5) . Both SBP and DBP increase linearly up to the ﬁfth or sixth decade of life, after which DBP gradually decreases while SBP continues to rise (S10.3.1-6) . Thus, isolated systolic hypertension is the predominant form of hypertension in older persons (S10.3.1-7,S10.3.1-8) . RCTs have clearly demonstrated that JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e191 BP lowering in isolated systolic hypertension (deﬁned as SBP $160 mm Hg with variable DBP #90, #95, or #110 mm Hg) is effective in reducing the risk of fatal and nonfatal stroke (primary outcome), cardiovascular events, and death (S10.3.1-9 — S10.3.1-12) . Cross-sectional and longitudinal epidemiologic studies in older adults have raised questions about the beneﬁts of more intensive antihypertensive treatment and the rela- tionship between BP lowering and risk of falls(S10.3.1-13) . Treatment of elevated BP in older persons is challenging because of a high degree of heterogeneity in comorbidity, as well as poly-pharmacy, frailty, cognitive impairment, and variable life expectancy. However, over the past 3 decades, RCTs of antihypertensive therapy have included large numbers of older persons, and in every instance, including when the SBP treatment goal was<120 mm Hg, more intensive treatment has safely reduced the risk of CVD for persons over the ages of 65, 75, and 80 years (S10.3.1-1,S10.3.1-14) . Both HYVET (Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial) and SPRINT included those who were frail but still living independently in the community (S10.3.1-1,S10.3.1-14) ,a n db o t hw e r es t o p p e de a r l yf o r beneﬁt (HYVET after 1.8 years and SPRINT after 3.26 years). In fact, BP-lowering therapy is one of the few in- terventions shown to reduce mortality risk in frail older individuals. RCTs in noninstitutionalized community- dwelling older persons have also demonstrated that improved BP control does not exacerbate orthostatic hy- potension and has no adverse impact on risk of injurious falls (S10.3.1-1,S10.3.1-15,S10.3.1-16) .I ts h o u l db en o t e d , however, that SPRINT excluded those with low ( <110 mm Hg) standing BP on study entry. Older persons need to be carefully monitored for orthostatic hypotension during treatment. Intensive B P control increases the risk of acute kidney injury, but this is no different from the risk seen in younger adults (S10.3.1-1) . In summary, despite the complexity of management in caring for older persons with hypertension, RCTs have demonstrated that in many community-dwelling older adults, even adults >80 years of age, BP-lowering goals during antihyper- tensive treatment need not differ from those selected for persons <65 years of age (S10.3.1-17) . Importantly, no randomized trial of BP lowering in persons >65 years of age has ever shown harm or less beneﬁt for older versus younger adults. However, clinicians should implement careful titration of BP lowering and monitoring in persons with high comorbidity burden; large RCTs have excluded older persons at any age who live in nursing homes, as well as those with prevalent dementia and advanced HF. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. We recommend ASCVD risk assessment in all adults with hypertension, including older persons. As a matter of convenience, however, it can be assumed that the vast majority of older adults have a 10-year ASCVD risk $ 10%, placing them in the high risk cate- gory that requires initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy at BP $ 130/80 mm Hg (see Section 8.1.2 , Figure 4 and Table 23 for BP thresholds for initiating antihypertensive drug treatment). Large RCTs using medications to reduce hypertension-related CVD risk with a mean follow-up of$2y e a r sh a v en o wi n c l u d e da large number of adults $65 years of age. These trials have enrolled a broad range of ages $65 years, including persons in their 90s and even 100s, as well as those with mild-to-moderate frailty but who were ambulatory and able to travel to a treatment clinic. In these patients, RCTs have shown that BP lowering decreased CVD morbidity and mortality but did not increase the risk of orthostatic hypotension or falls (S10.3.1-1,S10.3.1-15,S10.3.1-16) .A n a l y s i so ft h e NHANES (2011–2014) data set indicates that 88% of U.S. adults (98% men and 80% women)$65 years old have a1 0 - y e a rp r e d i c t e dA S C V Dr i s k$10% or have a history of CVD (CHD, stroke, or HF). For persons$75 years of age, 100% have an ASCVD risk score$10% or a history of CVD. Therefore, the BP target of #130/80 mm Hg would be appropriate (see Section 8.1.2 ). Initiation of antihypertensive therapy with 2 agents should be un- dertaken cautiously in older persons, and they need to be monitored carefully for orthostatic hypotension and history of falls. In SPRINT, the beneﬁtw a sf o ra nS B P goal of <120 mm Hg. Older persons may present with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension associated with supine hypertension. This is particularly common in Parkinson ’s disease and other neurodegenerative dis- orders. For management of this problem, the reader is referred to the recommendations of a 2017 consensus panel (S10.3.1-18) . 2. Patients with prevalent and frequent falls, advanced cognitive impairment, and multiple comorbidities may be at risk of adverse outcomes with intensive BP lowering, especially when they require multiple BP- lowering medications. Older persons in this category typically reside in nursing homes and assisting living facilities, are unable to live independently in the community, and have not been represented in RCTs. 10.3.2. Children and Adolescents Pediatric guidelines are ava ilable from other organiza- tions (S10.3.2-1,S10.3.2-2) . The 2011 report updates the 2004 report for publications through 2008 (antihyper- tensive medication trials, normative data on pediatric BP) but is otherwise unchanged. In the 2011 guideline (S10.3.2-3) ,B Pw a ss t r a t iﬁed into normal, pre- hypertension (90th percentil et o9 5 t hp e r c e n t i l e ) ,s t a g e1 Whelton et al.

These deﬁnitions were designed to be analogous to deﬁ- nitions in the extant JNC 7 report; for older adolescents ($14 years), the JNC 7 thresholds generally apply(S10.3.2- 4). Treatment recommendations are based on hyperten- sion severity, published short-term clinical trials of antihypertensive treatment, age, coexisting CVD risk factors, and risk strati ﬁcation by presence of LVH on echocardiogram. The treatment goal is to achieve BP <90th percentile. New tabl es for ambulatory BP dis- t r i b u t i o ni nc h i l d r e nh a v eb e e nd e v e l o p e d .Ac l a s s iﬁca- tion of BP that is based on these ambulatory BP results has been proposed (S10.3.2-5,S10.3.2-6) . A new pediatric BP guideline was published in late 2017(S10.3.2-7) . 11. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 11.1.

BP indicates blood pressure; CKD, chronic kidney disease; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; eGFR, estimated glomerularﬁltration rate; NSAIDs, nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs; and SBP, systolic blood pressure. Adapted with permission from Calhoun et al.(S11.1-1) (American Heart Association, Inc.). JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al.

On the basis of the previous cutoff of 140/90 mm Hg, the prevalence of resistant hypertension is approximately 13% in the adult population (S11.1-2,S11.1-3) .M u l t i p l e single-cohort studies have indicated that common risk factors for resistant hypertension include older age, obesity, CKD, black race, and DM. Estimates suggest the prevalence would be about 4% higher with the newly recommended control target of <130/80 mm Hg (subject to validation in future study). The prognosis of resistant hypertension (by the previous de ﬁnition) (S11.1-1) , compared with the prognosis of those who more readily achieve control, has not been fully ascertained; however, risk of MI, stroke, ESRD, and death in adults with resistant hypertension and CHD may be 2- to 6-fold higher than in hypertensive adults withou t resistant hypertension (S11.1-4 — S11.1-6) . The evaluation of resistant hyperten- sion involves consideration of many patient characteris- tics, pseudoresistance (BP technique, white coat hypertension, and medication compliance), and screening for secondary causes of hypertension (Figure 10; Section 5.4; Table 13 ). The term “refractory hypertension ” has been used to refer to an extreme phenotype of antihy- pertensive treatment failure, deﬁned as failure to control BP despite use of at least 5 antihypertensive agents of different classes, including a long-acting thiazide-type diuretic, such as chlorthalidone, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, such as spironolactone (S11.1-7) .T h e prevalence of refractory hypertension is low; patients with refractory hypertension experience high rates of CVD complications, including LVH, HF, and stroke. Treatment of resistant hypertension involves improving medication adherence, improving detection and correction of secondary hypertension, and address- ing other patient characteristics (S11.1-8 — S11.1-10) .P h a r - macological therapy with combinations of medications with complementary mechanisms of action provides an empirical approach that enhances BP control while mitigating untoward effects of potent vasodilators (e.g., ﬂuid retention and re ﬂex tachycardia). CCBs, inhibitors of RAS, and chlorthalidone comprise a common 3-drug regimen (S11.1-11) . Considerable evidence indicates that the addition of spironolactone to multidrug regimens provides substantial BP reduction (S11.1-12) when compared with placebo. Substantial data also demon- strate the advantage of spironolactone as compared with other active drugs (S11.1-8,S11.1-13 — S11.1-15) .I np a r t i c - ular, the recent PATHWAY-2 (Optimum Treatment for Drug-Resistant Hypertension) RCT demonstrated the superiority of spironolactone over alpha and beta blockers (S11.1-13) . There is also clinical trial evidence that the addition of hydralazine or minoxidil is effective in achieving BP control in patients resistant to usual combination therapy (S11.1-8,S11.1-12 — S11.1-16) .T h e dosing of multidrug regimens, occasionally including nighttime dosing, may be best optimized by hyperten- sion specialists. Several studies have investigated devices that inter- rupt sympathetic nerve activity (carotid baroreceptor pacing and catheter ablation of renal sympathetic nerves); however, these studies have not provided sufﬁcient evi- dence to recommend the use of these device in managing resistant hypertension (S11.1-8 — S11.1-10) .I np a r t i c u l a r ,2 RCTS of renal sympathetic n e r v ea b l a t i o nh a v eb e e n negative (S11.1-8,S11.1-9) . 11.2. Hypertensive Crises— Emergencies and Urgencies Recommendations for Hypertensive Crises and Emergencies References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplement 55 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS I B-NR 1. In adults with a hypertensive emergency, admission to an intensive care unit is recommended for continuous monitoring of BP and target organ damage and for parenteral administration of an appropriate agent (Tables 19 and 20) (S11.2-1,S11.2-2) . I C-EO 2. For adults with a compelling condition (i.e., aortic dissection, severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, or pheochromocytoma crisis), SBP should be reduced to less than 140 mm Hg during theﬁrst hour and to less than 120 mm Hg in aortic dissection. I C-EO 3. For adults without a compelling condition, SBP should be reduced by no more than 25% within theﬁrst hour; then, if stable, to 160/100 mm Hg within the next 2 to 6 hours; and then cautiously to normal during the following 24 to 48 hours. Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e194 Synopsis Hypertensive emergencies are deﬁned as severe eleva- tions in BP (>180/120 mm Hg) associated with evidence of new or worsening target organ damage (S11.2-3 — S11.2-6) . The 1-year death rate associated with hypertensive emer- gencies is >79%, and the median survival is 10.4 months if the emergency is left untreated (S11.2-7) . The actual BP l e v e lm a yn o tb ea si m p o r t a n ta sthe rate of BP rise; patients with chronic hypertension can often tolerate higher BP levels than previously normot ensive individuals. Hyper- tensive emergencies demand immediate reduction of BP (not necessarily to normal) to prevent or limit further target organ damage. Exampl es of target organ damage include hypertensive encephalopathy, ICH, acute ischemic stroke, acute MI, acute LV failure with pulmonary edema, unstable angina pectoris, dissecting aortic aneurysm, acute renal failure, and eclampsia. In general, use of oral therapy is discouraged for hypertensive emergencies. Hypertensive emergencies in patients with acute ICH and acute ischemic stroke are discussed inSection 9.4. In contrast, hypertensive u rgencies are situations associated with severe BP elevation in otherwise stable patients without acute or impending change in target organ damage or dysfunction. Many of these patients have withdrawn from or are noncompliant with antihy- pertensive therapy and do not have clinical or laboratory evidence of acute target organ damage. These patients should not be considered as having a hypertensive emergency and instead are treated by reinstitution or intensi ﬁcation of antihypertensive drug therapy and treatment of anxiety as applicable. There is no indication for referral to the emergency department, immediate reduction in BP in the emergency department, or hospi- talization for such patients. Figure 11 is an algorithm on diagnosis and management of a hypertensive crisis. Tables 19 and 20 summarize FIGURE 11 Diagnosis and Management of a Hypertensive Crisis Colors correspond to Class of Recommendation inTable 1. *Use drug(s) speciﬁed inTable 19. †If other comorbidities are present, select a drug speciﬁed in Table 20.

MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e195 intravenous antihypertensive drugs for treatment of hypertensive emergencies. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. There is no RCT evidence that antihypertensive drugs reduce morbidity or mortality in patients with hyper- tensive emergencies (S11.2-8) . However, from clinical experience, it is highly likely that antihypertensive therapy is an overall bene ﬁt in a hypertensive emer- gency (S11.2-9) . There is also no high-quality RCT evi- dence to inform clinicians as to which ﬁrst-line antihypertensive drug class provides more beneﬁtt h a n harm in hypertensive emergencies (S11.2-8) .T h i sl a c k of evidence is related to the small size of trials, the lack of long-term follow-up, and failure to report outcomes. However, 2 trials have demonstrated that nicardipine may be better than labetalol in achieving the short- term BP target (S11.2-1,S11.2-10 — S11.2-12) . Several anti- hypertensive agents in various pharmacological classes a r ea v a i l a b l ef o rt h et r e a t m e n to fh y p e r t e n s i v ee m e r - gencies ( Table 19 ). Because autoregulation of tissue perfusion is disturbed in hypertensive emergencies, continuous infusion of short- acting titratable antihy- pertensive agents is often preferable to prevent further target organ damage (S11.2-5,S11.2-6) . The selection of an antihypertensive agent should be based on the drug’s pharmacology, pathophysiological factors un- derlying the patient’s hypertension (as well as they can be rapidly determined), degree of progression of target organ damage, the desirable rate of BP decline, and the TABLE 19 Intravenous Antihypertensive Drugs for T reatment of Hypertensive Emergencies Class Drug(s) Usual Dose Range Comments CCB— dihydropyridines Nicardipine Initial 5 mg/h, increasing every 5 min by 2.5 mg/h to maximum 15 mg/h. Contraindicated in advanced aortic stenosis; no dose adjustment needed for elderly. Clevidipine Initial 1 –2 mg/h, doubling every 90 s until BP approaches target, then increasing by less than double every 5–10 min; maximum dose 32 mg/h; maximum duration 72 h. Contraindicated in patients with soybean, soy product, egg, and egg product allergy and in patients with defective lipid metabolism (e.g., pathological hyperlipidemia, lipoid nephrosis or acute pancreatitis). Use low-end dose range for elderly patients. Vasodilators— Nitric- oxide dependent Sodium nitroprusside Initial 0.3–0.5 mcg/kg/min; increase in increments of 0.5 mcg/kg/min to achieve BP target; maximum dose 10 mcg/kg/min; duration of treatment as short as possible. For infusion rates $4–10 mcg/kg/min or duration>30 min, thiosulfate can be coadministered to prevent cyanide toxicity. Intra-arterial BP monitoring recommended to prevent“overshoot.” Lower dosing adjustment required for elderly. Tachyphylaxis common with extended use. Cyanide toxicity with prolonged use can result in irreversible neurological changes and cardiac arrest. Nitroglycerin Initial 5 mcg/min; increase in increments of 5 mcg/ min every 3–5 min to a maximum of 20 mcg/min. Use only in patients with acute coronary syndrome and/or acute pulmonary edema. Do not use in volume-depleted patients. Vasodilators— direct Hydralazine Initial 10 mg via slow IV infusion (maximum initial dose 20 mg); repeat every 4–6 h as needed. BP begins to decrease within 10–30 min, and the fall lasts 2–4h . Unpredictability of response and prolonged duration of action do not make hydralazine a desirableﬁrst-line agent for acute treatment in most patients. Adrenergic blockers— beta 1 receptor selective antagonist Esmolol Loading dose 500 –1000 mcg/kg/min over 1 min followed by a 50-mcg/kg/min infusion. For additional dosing, the bolus dose is repeated and the infusion increased in 50-mcg/kg/min increments as needed to a maximum of 200 mcg/kg/min. Contraindicated in patients with concurrent beta-blocker therapy, bradycardia, or decompensated HF. Monitor for bradycardia. May worsen HF. Higher doses may block beta2 receptors and impact lung function in reactive airway disease. Adrenergic blockers— combined alpha1 and nonselective beta receptor antagonist Labetalol Initial 0.3 –1.0-mg/kg dose (maximum 20 mg) slow IV injection every 10 min or 0.4–1.0-mg/kg/h IV infusion up to 3 mg/kg/h. Adjust rate up to total cumulative dose of 300 mg. This dose can be repeated every 4–6h . Contraindicated in reactive airways disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Especially useful in hyperadrenergic syndromes. May worsen HF and should not be given in patients with second- or third-degree heart block or bradycardia. Adrenergic blockers— nonselective alpha receptor antagonist Phentolamine IV bolus dose 5 mg. Additional bolus doses every 10 min as needed to lower BP to target. Used in hypertensive emergencies induced by catecholamine excess (pheochromocytoma, interactions between monamine oxidase inhibitors and other drugs or food, cocaine toxicity, amphetamine overdose, or clonidine withdrawal). Dopamine 1-receptor selective agonist Fenoldopam Initial 0.1 –0.3 mcg/kg/min; may be increased in increments of 0.05–0.1 mcg/kg/min every 15 min until target BP is reached. Maximum infusion rate 1.6 mcg/kg/min. Contraindicated in patients at risk of increased intraocular pressure (glaucoma) or intracranial pressure and those with sulﬁte allergy. ACE inhibitor Enalaprilat Initial 1.25 mg over a 5-min period. Doses can be increased up to 5 mg every 6 h as needed to achieve BP target. Contraindicated in pregnancy and should not be used in acute MI or bilateral renal artery stenosis. Mainly useful in hypertensive emergencies associated with high plasma renin activity. Dose not easily adjusted. Relatively slow onset of action (15 min) and unpredictability of BP response. BP indicates blood pressure; CCB, calcium channel blocker; HF, heart failure; IV, intravenous; and MI, myocardial infarction. Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e196 presence of comorbidities ( Table 20). The therapeutic goal is to minimize target organ damage safely by rapid recognition of the problem and early initiation of appropriate antihypertensive treatment. 2. Compelling conditions requiring rapid lowering of SBP, usually to <140 mm Hg, in theﬁrst hour of treatment include aortic dissection, severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, and pheochromocytoma with hypertensive crisis. 3. There is no RCT evidence comparing different strate- gies to reduce BP, except in patients with ICH (S11.2- 9,S11.2-13) . Neither is there RCT evidence to suggest how rapidly or how much BP should be lowered in a hypertensive emergency (S11.2-9) . However, clinical experience indicates that excessive reduction of BP may cause or contribute to renal, cerebral, or coronary ischemia and should be avoided. Thus, comprehensive dosing of intravenous or even oral antihypertensive agents to rapidly lower BP is not without risk. Oral loading doses of antihypertensive agents can engender cumulative effects, causing hypotension after discharge from the emergency department or clinic. 11.3. Cognitive Decline and Dementia TABLE 20 Intravenous Antihypertensive Drugs for Treatment of Hy pertensive Emergencies in Patients With Selected Comorbidities Comorbidity Preferred Drug(s) * Comments Acute aortic dissection Esmolol, labetalol Requires rapid lowering of SBP to #120 mm Hg. Beta blockade should precede vasodilator (e.g., nicardipine or nitroprusside) administration, if needed for BP control or to prevent reﬂex tachycardia or inotropic effect; SBP#120 mm Hg should be achieved within 20 min. Acute pulmonary edema Clevidipine, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside Beta blockers contraindicated. Acute coronary syndromes Esmolol, † labetalol, nicardipine, nitroglycerin† Nitrates given in the presence of PDE-5 inhibitors may induce profound hypotension. Contraindications to beta blockers include moderate-to-severe LV failure with pulmonary edema, bradycardia (<60 bpm), hypotension (SBP<100 mm Hg), poor peripheral perfusion, second- or third-degree heart block, and reactive airways disease. Acute renal failure Clevidipine, fenoldopam, nicardipine N/A Eclampsia or preeclampsia Hydralazine, labetalol, nicardipine Requires rapid BP lowering. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, renin inhibitors, and nitroprusside contraindicated. Perioperative hypertension (BP $160/90 mm Hg or SBP elevation $20% of the preoperative value that persists for>15 min) Clevidipine, esmolol, nicardipine, nitroglycerin Intraoperative hypertension is most frequently seen during anesthesia induction and airway manipulation. Acute sympathetic discharge or catecholamine excess states (e.g., pheochromocytoma, post-carotid endarterectomy status) Clevidipine, nicardipine, phentolamine Requires rapid lowering of BP.

Recommendation for Prevention of Cognitive Decline and Dementia References that support the recommendation are summarized in Online Data Supplement 56 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION IIa B-R 1. In adults with hypertension, BP lowering is reasonable to prevent cognitive decline and dementia (S11.3-1 — S11.3-6) . JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e197 Synopsis Dementia is a leading cause of mortality and placement into nursing homes and assisted living facilities, affecting >46 million individuals globally and 5 million persons in the United States, a number that is expected to double by 2050 (S11.3-7) . A 5-year delay in onset of dementia would likely decrease the number of cases of incident dementia by about 50% after several decades (S11.3-8) .V a s c u l a r disease and its risk factors are implicated in a large pro- portion of patients with dementia, including those with Alzheimer ’s dementia (S11.3-9 — S11.3-11) .H y p e r t e n s i o ni s also the primary risk fa ctor for small-vessel ischemic disease and cortical white matter abnormalities (S11.3-12 — S11.3-15) . Most observational studies have suggested that better control of SBP may reduce Alzheimer ’s disease and other dementias, and the evi- dence is stronger for BP lowering in middle age than in older adults (S11.3-9,S11.3-16) . Clinical trials with demen- tia assessment have evaluated all-cause dementia but not Alzheimer ’s disease speci ﬁcally. However, all of these trials have methodological issues, such as low power, insuf ﬁcient follow-up length, and inadequately designed dementia assessment batteries. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Five clinical trials of BP lowering have included assessment for incident dementia. Of these 5 trials, 4 demonstrated a reduction in dementia incidence, with 2 of these 4 demonstrating statistical signiﬁcance (746- 751). SYST-EUR (Systolic Hypertension in Europe) (S11.3-17) and PROGRESS (Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke) (S11.3-18) both showed sta- tistically signi ﬁcant reductions in incident dementia. SYST-EUR achieved an SBP of 152 mm Hg in the treat- m e n ta r m( 8 . 3m mH gl o w e rt h a np l a c e b oa r m )d u r i n g i t sb l i n d e dp h a s ea n da nS B Po f1 4 9m mH g( 7 . 0m mH g l o w e rt h a nc o m p a r i s o ng r o u p )d u r i n gi t so p e n - l a b e l follow-up phase (S11.3-2,S11.3-3) .P R O G R E S Sa c h i e v e d an SBP of 138 mm Hg in the treatment group (9 mm Hg lower than the placebo group) and demonstrated de- mentia prevention in patients with a recent stroke (S11.3-5) .T h et r i a ls h o w i n gn ob e n eﬁti nt h ed i r e c t i o n of dementia reduction achieved an SBP reduction of only 3.2 mm Hg, whereas the other 4 trials achieved SBP reductions of 7 to 15 mm Hg (746-751). When the rate of cognitive decline (not dementia) has been a trial outcome, 7 clinical trials of BP-lowering therapy have been completed, and 2 of these have shown bene ﬁt (S11.3-4 — S11.3-6,S11.3-19 — S11.3-22) .N or a n d o m i z e d trial of BP lowering has demonstrated an adverse impact on dementia incidence or cognitive function. However, the anticipated results from SPRINT, theﬁrst adequately powered RCT to test whether intensive BP control reduces dementia, may help clarify this issue in the near future. 11.4. Sexual Dysfunction and Hypertension An association among sexual dysfunction, atheroscle- rosis, and hypertension can be constructed from several epidemiology surveys, clinical trials, and cohort studies. Although these data converge to suggest that endothelial dysfunction is a common denominator, the story is incomplete. Sexual dysfunction represents several do- mains in desire or interest, as well as physical limitations such as erectile dysfunction. In addition, beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and other anti- hypertensive drugs can have negative effects on libido and erectile function. There are emerging data on the association between erectile dysfunction and CVD c o m p a r e dw i t ho t h e rd o m a i n so fs e x u a ld y s f u n c t i o n . Experimental and clinical studies describe a role for angiotensin II, endothelin, and hydrogen sul ﬁde on cavernous tissue function (S11.4-1) . Many of the signaling pathways for the increased production of oxidative stress and the subsequent deleterious effects of oxidative stress on vascular tissue have been described. Accordingly, it is r e a s o n a b l et os u g g e s tt h a thypertension might lead to vascular changes that cause erectile dysfunction but, conversely, erectile dysfunction may be part of the causal pathway to CVD (S11.4-1) . Although there is insuf ﬁcient evidence to recommend screening for CVD risk factors in all men with erectile dysfunction, it has been reported as a sole precursor for CVD in men(S11.4-2 — S11.4-6) . With the introduction of the phosphodiesterase-5 in- hibitors, which can be coadministered with antihyper- tensive medications, there is now effective therapy for erectile dysfunction that has implications for systemic vascular disease (S11.4-7) . These drugs have additive effects on lowering BP and are recommended as a pri- mary therapy for pulmonary hypertension (S11.4-8) . Although data are available to suggest that some anti- hypertensive medications affect erectile dysfunction more than others, the use of phosphodiesterase-5 in- hibitors make drug class distinctions for erectile dysfunction less relevant (S11.4-9) .T h el o n g - t e r m safety and ef ﬁcacy of chronic administration of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors for the mitigation of CVD has yet to be determined and represents an important knowledge gap.

Patients Undergoing Surgical Procedures Synopsis Hypertension in the perioperative period increases the risk of CVD, cerebrovascular events, and bleeding (S11.5-15,S11.5-16) . As many as 25% of patients who un- dergo major noncardiac surgery (S11.5-17) and 80% of patients who have cardiac surgery experience periop- erative hypertension (S11.5-16,S11.5-18) . In general, the level of risk is related to the severity of the hypertension. No high-quality RCTs were identi ﬁed relating to the treatment of hypertension in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. One analysis evaluated data from 3 prospective, randomized, ope n-label, parallel-compari- son studies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and concluded that clevidipine is a safe and effective treat- ment for acute hypertension in patients undergoing car- diac surgery (S11.5-19) . Another systematic review and meta-analysis, including 4 st udies, concluded that clevi- dipine is more effective than other antihypertensive drugs in the management of perioperative hypertension without adverse events (S11.5-20) . Several general strategies and principles based on experience and obser- vation are recommended for this section. In the man- agement of patients with perioperative hypertension, it is important to assess other potential contributing factors, such as volume status, pain control, oxygenation, and bladder distention, when the use of pharmacological therapy to control BP is under consideration. Uncon- trolled hypertension is associated with increased periop- erative and postoperative complications. Certain medications (e.g., beta blockers, clonidine) may be asso- ciated with rebound hypertension if discontinued abruptly (S11.5-13) . Therefore, several general strategies and principles based on experience and observation are recommended for this section. These recommendations for beta blockers, ACE in- hibitors, and ARBs are generally consistent with the“2014 ACC/AHA Guideline on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Management of Patients Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery ” and are provided to assist in the management of patients undergoing major noncardiac surgical procedures (S11.5-21) . Recommendations for Treatment of Hypertensio n in Patients Undergoing Surgical Procedures References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 57 and 58.

Patients with intraoperative hypertension s hould be managed with intravenous medications ( Table 19) until such time as oral medications can be resumed. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e199 Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. If well tolerated, beta blockers should be continued in patients who are currently receiving them for longitu- dinal reasons, particularly when longitudinal treat- ment is provided according to GDMT, such as for MI (S11.5-22) . Multiple observational studies support the beneﬁts of continuing beta blockers in patients who are undergoing surgery and who are on these agents for longitudinal indications (S11.5-1 — S11.5-7) . 2. In the absence of conclusive RCTs, the expert opinion of this writing committee is that control of BP to levels recommended by the present guideline (BP <130/80 mm Hg) or other target levels speciﬁed for a particular individual is reasonable before undertaking major elective procedures in either the inpatient or outpa- tient setting. If the patient is unable to take oral med- ications, it is reasonable to use intravenous medications ( Table 19 ) as necessary to control BP. Special consideration of pa renteral therapy usually occurs for patients taking clonidine or beta blockers because of the risk of stopping these medications acutely. Withdrawal sy ndromes, accompanied by sympathetic discharge and acute hypertension, can occur on cessation of these agents(S11.5-13) . 3. Data on the potential risk and beneﬁto fA C Ei n h i b i t o r s in the perioperative setting are limited to observational analyses, and this area is controversial. Recent evi- dence from a large cohort study demonstrates that patients who stopped their ACE inhibitors or ARBs 24 hours before noncardiac surgery were less likely to suffer the primary composite outcome (all-cause death, stroke, or myocardial injury) and intraoperative hypotension than were those continuing these medi- cations until surgery (S11.5-10) . 4. JNC 6(S11.5-23) noted conﬂicting evidence for patients with DBP >110 mm Hg and recommended delay of surgery for gradual reduction in DBP before proceeding with surgery. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 30 observational studies, preoperative hypertension was associated with a 35% increase in cardiovascular complications (S11.5-12) .A ni n c r e a s ei nc o m p l i c a t i o n s , including dysrhythmias, myocardial ischemia or infarction, neurological complications, and renal fail- ure, has been reported in patients with DBP $110 mm Hg immediately before surgery (S11.5-24) .I n contrast, patients with DBP <110 mm Hg do not appear to be at signi ﬁcantly increased risk (S11.5-25) .T h e relationship of systolic hypertension to surgical risk is less certain. Among patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, increased risk of postoperative hy- pertension and neurological defects were observed (S11.5-26) , and an increased risk of CVD morbidity after coronary artery bypass graft surgery has been observed in patients with isolated systolic hypertension (S11.5- 27). During induction of anesthesia for surgery, sym- pathetic action can result in a 20 – to 30–mm Hg in- crease in BP and a 15- to 20-bpm increase in heart rate among patients with normal BP(S11.5-24) . Exaggerated responses may occur in patients with poorly treated or u n t r e a t e dh y p e r t e n s i o nb ya sm u c ha s9 0m mH ga n d 40 bpm (S11.5-24) . With further anesthesia, the accompanying inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system and loss of baroreceptor control may result in intraoperative hypotension. Lability in BP appears more likely in patients with poorly controlled hyper- tension (S11.5-25) , whereas studies have observed that patients with controlled hypertension respond simi- larly to those who are normotensive (S11.5-28) .E a r l y work indicated that patients with severe hypertension (SBP > 210 mm Hg and DBP >105 mm Hg) had exag- gerated responses in BP during the induction of anes- thesia (S11.5-28) . 5. Although few studies describe risks of withdrawing beta blockers in the perioperative time period (S11.5- 2,S11.5-5) , longstanding evidence from other settings suggests that abrupt withdrawal of long-term beta blockers is harmful(S11.5-29 — S11.5-31) . There are fewer data to describe whether short-term (1 to 2 days) peri- operative use of beta blockers, followed by rapid discontinuation, is harmful (S11.5-5,S11.5-14,S11.5- 21,S11.5-30) . 6. The 2014 ACC/AHA perioperative guideline speciﬁcally recommends against starting beta blockers on the day of surgery in beta-blocker–naive patients (S11.5-5,S11.5- 21,S11.5-30) , particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and if there are no plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events. Data from the POISE (Perioperative Ischemic Evaluation) study demonstrate the risk of initiating long-acting beta blockers on the day of surgery(S11.5-14) . 7.

STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE HYPERTENSION TREATMENT AND CONTROL In addition to promoting pharmacological and non- pharmacological treatment adherence in individual pa- tients with hypertension, s everal popula tion-based systems approaches can play an important role in treat- ment goals. 12.1. Adherence Strategies for Treatment of Hypertension Therapeutic nonadherence (not following recommended medical or health advice, including failure to “persist ” Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e200 with medications and recommended lifestyle modi ﬁca- tions) is a major contributor to poor control of hyperten- sion and a key barrier to reducing CVD deaths. Adherence rates vary substantially in different populations and, in general, are lower for lifestyle change and more behav- iorally demanding regimens. 12.1.1. Antihypertensive Medication Adherence Strategies Recommendations for Antihypertensive Medication Adherence Strategies References that support recommendations are summarized in Online Data Supplements 59 and 60. COR LOE RECOMMENDATIONS I B-R 1. In adults with hypertension, dosing of antihypertensive medication once daily rather than multiple times daily is beneﬁcial to improve adherence (S12.1.1-1 — S12.1.1-3) . IIa B-NR 2. Use of combination pills rather than free individual components can be useful to improve adherence to antihypertensive therapy (S12.1.1-4 — S12.1.1-7) . Synopsis Up to 25% of patients do notﬁll their initial prescription for antihypertensive therapy (S12.1.1-8 — S12.1.1-10) .D u r i n g the ﬁrst year of treatment, the average patient has possession of antihypertensive medications only 50% of the time, and only 1 in 5 patients has suf ﬁciently high adherence to achieve the bene ﬁts observed in clinical trials (S12.1.1-11,S12.1.1-12) . Factors contributing to poor adherence are myriad, complex, and multilevel (S12.1.1-11,S12.1.1-13,S12.1.1-14) . Therefore, solutions to improve adherence may be intro- duced at patient, provider, and healthcare system levels (S12.1.1-13,S12.1.1-15,S12.1.1-16) . Several systematic re- views and meta-analyses have assessed the impact of in- terventions on adherence to antihypertensive medications, including modi ﬁcation of antihypertensive therapy (S12.1.1-1 — S12.1.1-7,S12.1.1-11,S12.1.1-15,S12.1.1-16) . No single intervention is uniquely effective, and a sus- tained, coordinated effort that targets all barriers to adherence in an individual is likely to be the most effec- tive approach. See Online Data Supplement F for barriers to medication adherence and the most successful interventions. The creation of an encouraging, blame-free environ- ment in which patients are recognized for achieving treatment goals and given “permission ” to answer ques- tions related to their treatment honestly is essential to identify and address nonadhe rence. Patient medication adherence assessment tools (S12.1.1-17) are presented in Online Data Supplement A. Members of the hypertension care team may use these self-report tools in a nonthreat- ening fashion to identify barriers and facilitate behaviors associated with improved adherence to antihypertensive medications. Use of more objective methods (e.g., pill counts, data on medication re ﬁlls) to assess adherence along with self-report methods is optimal. Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. Remembering to take medication is often challenging, particularly for regimens that must be dosed several times daily. Taking medications several times throughout the day requires greater attention to scheduling, as well as additional issues such as trans- portation or storage, which can be challenging for some patients. The impact of once-daily dosing of antihy- pertensive drugs versus dosing multiple times daily has been evaluated in several meta-analyses (S12.1.1-1 — S12.1.1-3) . Medication adherence was greatest with once-daily dosing (range 71% to 94%) and declined as dosing frequency increased (S12.1.1-1,S12.1.1-2) . 2. Assessment and possible modiﬁcation of drug therapy regimens can improve subop timal adherence. Simpli- fying medication regimens, either by less frequent dosing (i.e., once daily versus multiple times daily) or use of combination drug therapy, improves adherence. Available ﬁxed-dose combination drug therapy is listed in Online Data Supplement D. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e201 12.1.2. Strategies to Promote Lifestyle Modiﬁcation Synopsis The primary lifestyle modi ﬁcation interventions that can help reduce high BP are outlined inSection 6 (healthy diet, weight loss, exercise and moderate alcohol intake). In addition, tobacco cessation is crucial for CVD risk reduction. These modiﬁc a t i o n sa r ec e n t r a lt og o o dh e a l t h and require speci ﬁc motivational and cognitive inter- vention strategies designed to promote adherence to these healthy behaviors. High-quality evidence support- ing some of these strategies is provided in Online Data Supplement G . Additionally, interventions such as goal setting, provision of feedback, self-monitoring, follow- up, motivational interviewing, and promotion of self-suf ﬁciency are most effective when combined. Most individuals have clear expectations about what a new lifestyle will provide; if their experiences do not match these expectations, they will be dissatis ﬁed and less motivated to maintain a lifestyle change, particularly in environments that do not support healthy choices. Other factors that may inﬂuence adoption and maintenance of new physical activity or dietary behaviors include age, sex, baseline health status, and body mass index, as well as the presence of comorbid conditions and depression, which negatively affect adherence to most lifestyle change regimens (S12.1.2-1) . Primary strategies include cognitive-behavioral strategies for promoting behavior change, intervention processes and delivery strategies, and addressing cultural and social context variables that inﬂuence behavioral change. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. It is crucial to translate and implement into practice the most effective evidence-based strategies for adherence to nonpharmacological treatment for hypertension. Both adoption and maintenance of new CVD risk- reducing behaviors pose challenges for many in- dividuals. Success requires consideration of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, as well as indi- vidual, provider, and environmental factors that may inﬂuence the design of such interventions (S12.1.2-1) . High-quality evidence has shown that even modest sustained lifestyle changes can substantially reduce CVD morbidity and mortality (S12.1.2-1) .B e c a u s em a n y beneﬁcial effects of lifestyle changes accrue over time, long-term adherence maximizes individual and popu- lation beneﬁts. Interventions targeting sodium restric- tion, other dietary patterns, weight reduction, and new physical activity habits often result in impressive rates of initial behavior changes but frequently are not translated into long-term behavioral maintenance. 12.1.3. Improving Quality of Care for Resource-Constrained Populations The availability of ﬁnancial, informational, and instru- mental support resources can be important though not sole determinants of hypertension control (S12.1.3- 1,S12.1.3-2) . The management of hypertension in resource-constrained populations poses a challenge that will require the implementation of all recommendations discussed in Section 13 (Table 21), with speciﬁcs e n s i t i v i t y to challenges posed by limited ﬁnancial resources, including those related to hea lth literacy, alignment of and potential need to realign healthcare priorities by patients, the convenience and complexity of the management strategy, accessibility to health care, and health-related costs (including medications). Resource- constrained populations are also populations with high representation of groups most likely to manifest health disparities, including racial and ethnic minorities (see Section 10.1 ), residents located in rural areas, and older adults. The more comprehensive BP targets proposed in the present guideline will present added challenges in these populations. It is crucial to invest in measures to enhance health literacy and reinforce the importance of adhering to treatment strategies, while p aying attention to cultural sensitivities. These measures may include identi ﬁcation of and partnering with community resources and organi- zations devoted to hyperten sion control and cardiovas- cular health. Although comparative-effectiveness data documenting ef ﬁcacy of various interventions are limited, multidisciplinary team –based approaches and the use of community health workers (seeSections 12.1.1 and 12.2 ) have shown some utility, as has the use of Recommendation for Strategies to Promote Lifestyle Modi ﬁcation References that support the recommendation are summarized in Online Data Supplement 61 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION I C-EO 1. Effective behavioral and motivational strategies to a chieve a healthy lifestyle (i.e., tobacco cessation, weight loss, moderation in alcohol intake, increas ed physical activity, reduced sodium intake, and consumption of a healthy diet) are recommended for adults with hypertension (S12.1.2-1,S12.1.2-2) .

Long-acting once-daily medications (e.g., chlorthalidone, amlodipine) that are now available generically and often on discount formularies can often be used to reduce complexity of the regimen and promote adherence by decreasing the effect of missed medication dosages. When possible, presc riptions requiring longer than 30-day reﬁlls should be considered, especially once a stable regimen is achieved. Where appropriate, using scored tablets and pill cutters can decrease the cost of medication for patients. 12.2. Structured, Team-Based Care Interventions for Hypertension Control Recommendation for Structured, Team-Based Care Interventions for Hypertension Control References that support the recommendation are summarized in Online Data Supplement 62 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION IA 1. A team-based care approach is recommended for adults with hypertension (S12.2-1 — S12.2-7) . Synopsis Team-based care to improve BP control is a health systems –level, organizational intervention that in- corporates a multidisciplinary team to improve the quality of hypertension care for patients (S12.2-8 — S12.2- 10). Various team-based hypertension care models have been demonstrated to increase the proportion of in- dividuals with controlled BP and to reduce both SBP and DBP (S12.2-1 — S12.2-7,S12.2-11,S12.2-12) . A team-based care approach is patient centered and is frequently imple- mented as part of a multifaceted approach, with systems support for clinical decision making (i.e., treatment al- gorithms), collaboration, adherence to prescribed regimen, BP monitoring, and patient self-management. Team-based care for hypertension includes the patient, the patient ’s primary care provider, and other pro- fessionals, such as cardiologists, nurses, pharmacists, physician assistants, dietitians, social workers, and community health workers. These professionals com- plement the activities of th e primary care provider by providing process support and sharing the re- sponsibilities of hypertension care. Section 13 contains a comprehensive, patient-centered plan of care that should be the basis of all team-based care for hypertension. Team-based care aims to achieve effective control of hypertension by application of the strategies outlined in Online Data Supplement H (S12.2-3) . Delineation of indi- vidual team member roles on the basis of knowledge, skill set, and availability, as well as the patient’s needs, allows the primary care provider to delegate routine matters to the team, thereby permitting more time to manage com- plex and critical patient-care issues. Important imple- mentation aspects, such as type of team member added, role of team members relatedto medication management, and number of team members, in ﬂuence BP outcomes (S12.2-3,S12.2-13) . Team member roles should be clear to all team members and to patients and families. Team-based care often requires organizational change and reallocation of resources (S12.2-14,S12.2-15) .S y s t e m s - l e v e ls u p p o r t ,s u c ha su s eo fe l e c t r o n i ch e a l t hr e c o r d s (EHR) (see Section 12.3.1 ), clinical decision support (i.e., treatment algorithms), technology-based remote moni- toring (see Section 12.3.2), self-management support tools, and monitoring of performance, are likely to augment and intensify team-based care efforts to reduce high BP. Recommendation-Speci ﬁcS u p p o r t i v eT e x t 1. RCTs and meta-analyses of RCTs of team-based hypertension care involving nurse or pharmacist intervention demonstrated reductions in SBP and DBP and/or greater achievement of BP goals when compared with usual care (S12.2-1,S12.2-2,S12.2- 4,S12.2-5) . Similarly, systematic reviews of team- based care, including a review of studies that included community health workers, for patients with primary hypertension showed reductions in SBP and DBP and improvements in BP control, appointment keeping, and hypertension medication adherence as c o m p a r e dw i t hu s u a lc a r e(S12.2-3,S12.2-12) .

Health Information Technology–Based Strategies to Promote Hypertension Control 12.3.1. EHR and Patient Registries Synopsis A growing number of health systems are developing or using registries and EHR that permit large-scale queries to support population health management strategies to identify undiagnosed or undertreated hypertension. Such innovations are implemented as ongoing quality improvement initiatives in clinical practice. To reduce undiagnosed hypertension and improve hypertension management, a multipronged approach may include 1) application of hypertensio n screening algorithms to EHR databases to identify at-risk patients, 2) contacting at-risk patients to schedule BP measurements, 3) monthly writ- ten feedback to clinicians about at-risk patients who have yet to complete a BP measurement, and 4) electronic prompts for BP measurements whenever at-risk patients visit the clinic (S12.3.1-1,S12.3.1-2) . Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1.

Telehealth strategies can be useful adjuncts to interventions shown to reduce BP for adults with hypertension (S12.3.2-1 — S12.3.2-5) . Synopsis Telehealth strategies, suc h as telemedicine, digital health ( “eHealth ”), and use of mobile computing and communication technologies ( “mHealth ”), are new and innovative tools to facilitate improvements in managing patients with hypertension. m Health interventions show promise in reducing SBP in patients with hypertension but with large variability in behavioral targets, intervention components, delivery modalities, and patient engagement (S12.3.2-5) . In addition, there are important implications f o rt h er o l eo fs o c i a ln e t w o r k s ,s o c i a lm e d i a ,a n de l e c t r o n i c technology as viable components of weight management and other lifestyle modiﬁcation and disease management programs (S12.3.2-6) . Commonly used telehealth interventions for hyperten- sion management are listed in Online Data Supplement I. Wireless technologies ( Online Data Supplement I ) allow linking BP devices and other measurement devices to telephone- or Internet-based transmission systems or to Wi-Fi access points available in users ’ homes and in communities. Some systems require patients to manually enter data, which is then forwarded to a remote computer Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e204 or the mobile device of the telehealth provider through a telephone line or the Internet (S12.3.2-7) .W h e nd a t aa r e received, they are stored and analyzed, and reports are generated, including variations and averages in BP and other parameters over the recording period. Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Meta-analyses of RCTs of different telehealth in- terventions have demonstrated greater SBP and DBP reductions (S12.3.2-1,S12.3.2-2,S12.3.2-4) and a larger proportion of patients achieving BP control (S12.3.2-2) than those achieved with usual care without tele- health. The effect of variou s telehealth interventions on BP lowering was signiﬁcantly greater than that of BP self-monitoring without transmission of BP data, which suggests a possible added value of the teletransmission approach (S12.3.2-1,S12.3.2-3) . Although mHealth in- terventions in general showed promise in reducing SBP in patients with hypertension, results were inconsis- tent (S12.3.2-5) . It is unclear which combination of tel- ehealth intervention featu r e si sm o s te f f e c t i v e ,a n d telehealth has not been demonstrated to be effective as a standalone strategy for improving hypertension control. 12.4. Improving Quality of Care for Patients With Hypertension 12.4.1. Performance Measures Recommendation for Performance Measures References that support the recommendation are summarized in Online Data Supplement 65 . COR LOE RECOMMENDATION IIa B-NR 1. Use of performance measures in combination with other quality improvement strategies at patient-, provider-, and system-based levels is reasonabl e to facilitate optimal hypertension control (S12.4.1-1 — S12.4.1-3) . Synopsis Efforts to improve suboptimal medical care include the use of performance measures, which are de ﬁned as standardized, validated a pproaches to assess whether correct healthcare processes are being performed and that desired patient outcomes are being achieved (S12.4.1-4) . Performance measures are often combined with other quality improvem ent strategies, such as cer- tiﬁcation or ﬁnancial incentives tied to higher-quality care (S12.4.1-5) .G u i d e l i n e sh e l pd eﬁne clinical care standards that can be used to develop performance measures. As guidelines evolve over time to incorporate new evidence, related performance measures may also evolve. Because identi ﬁcation, treatment, and control of hypertension are suboptimal, performance measures for hypertension control hav e been developed and recom- mended for use in quality improvement projects aimed at improving hypertension control and related outcomes in clinical practice (S12.4.1-6 — S12.4.1-8) .B e c a u s et h es p e c iﬁc methods used in performance measures can have an impact on their accuracy and ultimate impact (e.g., the method of BP measurement used in the assessment), they should be developed, tested, and implemented according to published standards (S12.4.1-9) .S e e Online Data Supplement J for publicly available performance mea- sures to assess the quality of hypertension care (generally using JNC 7 criteria).

COR LOE RECOMMENDATION IIa B-R 1. Use of quality improvement strategies at the health system, provider, and patient levels to improve identi ﬁcation and control of hypertension can be effective (S12.4.2-1 — S12.4.2-8) . JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e205 Synopsis High-quality BP management is multifactorial and requires the engagement of patients, families, pro- viders, and healthcare delivery systems (S12.4.2-9) .T h e difference between patient outcomes achieved with current hypertension treatment methods and patient outcomes thought to be possible with best-practice treatment methods is known as a quality gap, and such gaps are at least partly responsible for the loss of thousands of lives each year (S12.4.2-10) . This includes expanding patient and healthcare provider awareness, appropriate lifestyle modi ﬁcations, access to care, evidence-based treatment, a high level of medication adherence, and adequate follow-up (S12.4.2-9) . Quality improvement strategies or interventions aimed at reducing the quality gap for a group of patients who are representative of those encountered in routine practice have been effective in improving the hypertension care and outcomes across a wide variety of clinic and community settings (S12.4.2-1 — S12.4.2-4,S12.4.2-6, S12.4.2-8,S12.4.2-10) . Hypertension quality improvement strategies, with examples of substrategies that have been demonstrated to reduce BP and improve BP, are provided inOnline Data Supplement E. Because the effects of the different quality improvement strategies varied across trials, and most trials included >1 quality improvement strategy, it is not possible to discern which speci ﬁc quality improvement strategies have the greatest effects. Team-based care (see Section 12.4) and an organized system of regular re- view, with antihypertensive drug therapy implemented via a stepped-care protocol, had a clinically signi ﬁcant effect on reducing SBP and DBP and improving BP control. The assessed strategies in Online Data Supplement Emay be beneﬁcial under some circumstances and in varying combinations (S12.4.2-1 — S12.4.2-5) .N a t i o n a li n i t i a t i v e s such as Million Hearts Make Control Your Goal Blood Pressure Toolkit and Team Up Pressure Down provide quality improvement tools to support hypertension care in communities and clinical settings(S12.4.2-11) .

Synopsis With the evolution of the U.S. health system to reward “value over volume, ” payment systems have focused on ﬁnancial incentives to improve quality of care. Use of performance measures promulgated by national organi- zations, governmental payers, and commercial payers have fostered greater attention to control of high BP among healthcare providers and their patients. These performance measures have formed the basis for deter- mining ﬁnancial incentives for pay for performance ini- t i a t i v e s ,c o m m e r c i a li n s u r e r“pay-for-value ” contracts, and the Medicare Shared Savings Programs developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Innovation for Accountable Care Organizations. In addition, the Cen- ters for Medicare and Medicaid Services has developed The Million Hearts: Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Model, which is an RCT designed to identify and test scalable models of care delivery that reduce CVD risk (S12.5-5) . Greater attention is being paid to the in ﬂuence of health insurance coverage and bene ﬁtd e s i g n sf o c u s e d on reducing patient copayments for antihypertensive medications. Whelton et al.

Reduced copayments for health care, including for medications, and improved outcomes of hypertension care have been identiﬁed in several U.S. studies and in single studies in Finland, Israel, and Brazil (S12.5-4) . This is consistent with other evidence on how copay- m e n t sr e d u c eu p t a k eo fc a r ea n dh a si m p l i c a t i o n sf o r policy makers, particularly because the balance of ev- idence does not suggest that reducing medication copayments leads to an increase in overall healthcare expenditure. 13. THE PLAN OF CARE FOR HYPERTENSION Recommendation for the Plan of Care for Hypertension COR LOE RECOMMENDATION I C-EO 1. Every adult with hypertension should have a clear, detailed, and current evidence-based plan of care that ensures the achievement of treatment and self-management goals, encourages effective management of comorbid conditions, prompts timely follow-up w ith the healthcare team, and adheres to CVD GDMT (Table 22). Synopsis As p e c iﬁc plan of care for hypertension is essential and should reﬂect understanding of the modi ﬁable and non- modiﬁable determinants of health behaviors, including the social determinants of risk and outcomes. A clinician’s sequential ﬂow chart for management of hypertension is presented in Table 21. Detailed evidence-based elements o ft h ep l a no fc a r ea r el i s t e di nTable 22. The determinants will vary among demographic subgroups (see Section 10 for additional information). Recommendation-Speci ﬁc Supportive Text 1. Studies demonstrate that implementation of a plan of care for hypertension can lead to sustained reduction of BP and attainment of BP targets over several years (S13-1 — S13-6) Meta-analysis of RCTs shows reductions in BP of patients with hypertension and achievement of BP goals at 6 months and 1 year when compared with usual care. 13.1. Health Literacy Communicating alternative behaviors that support self- management of healthy BP in addition to medication adherence is important. This should be done both verbally and in writing. Today, mobile phones have a recording option. For patients with mobile phones, the phone can be used to inform patients and family members of medical instructions after the doctor ’s visit as an additional level of communication. Inclusion of a family member or friend that can help interpret and encourage self-management treatment goals is suggested when appropriate. Exam- ples of needed communication for alternative behaviors include a speciﬁc regimen relating to physical activity; a speci ﬁc sodium-reduced meal plan indicating selections for breakfast, lunch, and di nner; lifestyle recommenda- tions relating to sleep, rest, and relaxation; and ﬁnally, suggestions and alternatives to environmental barriers, such as barriers that prevent healthy food shopping or limit reliable transportation to and from appointments with health providers and pharmacy visits. 13.2. Access to Health Insurance and Medication Assistance Plans Health insurance and medication plan assistance for patients is especially impo rtant to improving access to and affordability of medical care and BP medications. Learning how the patient ﬁnancially supports and budgets for his or her medical care and medications offers the opportunity to share additional insight relating to cost reductions, including restructured pay- ment plans. Ideally, this would improve the patient ’s compliance with medicatio n adherence and treatment goals. 13.3. Social and Community Services Health care can be strengthened through local partner- ships. Hypertensive patients, particularly patients with l o w e ri n c o m e s ,h a v em o r eo p p o r t u n i t yt oa c h i e v et r e a t - ment goals with the assistance of strong local partner- ships. In patients with low socioeconomic status or patients who are challenged by social situations, integration of social and community services offers complementary reinforcem ent of clinically identi ﬁed treatment goals. Social and community services are help- ful when explicitly related to medical care. However, additional ﬁnancial support and ﬁnancial services are incredibly bene ﬁcial to patients, some of whom may JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al.

SUMMARY OF BP THRESHOLDS AND GOALS FOR PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY Several different BP thresholds and goals for the long- term treatment of hypertension with pharmacological therapy are recommended in this guideline. To provide a quick reference for practicing clinicians, these are summarized for hypertensive patients in general and for those with speciﬁc comorbidities in Table 23. 15.

Whelton et al. JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 e208 hypertension to make strong recommendations across a broad range of medical conditions. Nonetheless, signi ﬁ- cant gaps in knowledge exist. Importantly, there are areas where epidemiological and natural history studies suggest that hypertension pre- vention or earlier treatment of hypertension might sub- stantially improve outcomes, but clinical trials are lacking to provide guidance. The combination of epidemiological data showing a graded relationship between BP and out- comes, particularly above a BP of 120/80 mm Hg, and the results of the SPRINT trial showing bene ﬁto fm o r e comprehensive treatment to a target BP of <120/80 mm Hg, suggests that a lifelong BP below that level will substantially lower CVD and CKD incidence. This is especially the case for younger individuals, those with DM, and those with high lifetime CVD risk based on the presence of multiple risk factors, including high BP. If hard, cardiovascular outcome clinical trials remain the sole driver of evidence-based guidelines, then deter- mining the full beneﬁt of earlier intervention may not be possible because of the cost and length of time needed for intervention. Outcomes may be different if antihy- pertensive treatment is initi ated earlier in the natural history of CVD. DM may provide a population in whom to test this hypothesis. Composite outcomes that include both prevention of events and surrogates, such as pre- vention of decline in renal function or amelioration of measures of subclinical atherosclerosis, vascular stiff- ness, or LV structure and function, should be considered. Otherwise, these younger individuals may be under- treated and experience mortality or CVD events before being old enough to enter hard outcome –driven trials such as SPRINT. Replication of SPRINT, especially in younger patients with DM and in countries where nonischemic stroke is the predominant cause of CVD, is highly desirable. Likewise, implementation studies that demonstrate the practicality of SPRINT-like interventions in resource-constrained practice settings are needed. More information is urgen tly needed relating hyper- tensive target organ damage to CVD risk and outcomes. Should the identiﬁcation of target organ damage and hy- pertensive heart disease prompt more aggressive BP management (i.e., increase the rationale for instituting pharmacological therapy earlier or more intensively? Should all patients with hypertension be screened with echocardiogram for LVH? Should echocardiography be repeated once LVH is noted? Is it important to document LVH regression? At present, there are no RCT data to inform guideline recommendations. ABPM and HBPM provide enhanced ability to both diagnose hypertension and monitor treatment. Although evidence is sufﬁcient to recommend incorporating these tools into clinical practice, more knowledge about them is required. Areas of inquiry include closer mapping of the relationship of outcomes to ambulatory and home BP measurements, so that de ﬁnitions of hypertension and hypertension severity based on these measures can be developed, including the importance of masked hypertension, white coat hypertension, and nocturnal hypertension. Reproducibility of ambulatory and home BPs must be studied, and cohorts should include a broader range of ethnicities. Trials with entry criteria and treatment goals based on ambulatory or home BP mea- sures should be conducted, including studies of masked and white coat hypertension. The practicality and cost of incorporating ABPM into EHR and routine care should be assessed. The existence of these techniques should not hamper efforts to investigate ways to improve accuracy in the measurement of clinic BP. Further research on improving accuracy of ofﬁce BP measurements, including number of measurements, training of personnel measuring BP, and device comparisons, will help stan- d a r d i z ec a r ea n dt h u si m p r o v eo u t c o m e s .T e c h n o l o g yf o r measurement of BP continues to evolve with the emer- gence of cufﬂess devices and other strategies that provide the opportunity for continuous noninvasive assessment of BP. The accuracy, cost, and usefulness of these new technologies will need to be assessed. The contemporary healthcare environment is dramati- cally different from the era in which awareness of hy- pertension as a risk factor and beneﬁts of treatment were discovered. With the advent of the EHR, complex calcu- lations of CVD risk and renal function can be incorporated into routine reports, and many new avenues to support intervention strategies are available to clinicians.

JACC VOL. 71, NO. 19, 2018 Whelton et al. MAY 15, 2018:e127 – 248 2017 High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline e209 Optimizing these approach es will require continued focused research. Recognition that simply applying what we know about BP control would have a large impact on population health, observations on inef ﬁciencies and excessive cost in the U.S. healthcare system, and the growth of information technology have led to promising studies of ways to improve and monitor hypertension care. Results of this research are reﬂected in this guide- line, but further work is required. Examples for study include the effectiveness of multidisciplinary healthcare teams to achieve BP treatment goals at lower cost, social media to maintain contact with patients, information technology to monitor outcomes and decrease practice variability, and incentives to providers to achieve better outcomes for patients. A key goal of these efforts should be to demonstrate reduction in healthcare disparities across ethnicity, sex, social and economic class, and age barriers. More research on the prevention of the development of hypertension and the beneﬁt of lifetime low BP should be conducted. In this regard, elucidation of genetic expres- sion, epigenetic effects, transcriptomics, and proteomics that link genotypes with longitudinal databases may add considerable knowledge about bene ﬁcial outcomes of lifelong lower BP, determinants of rise in BP over time, and identiﬁcation of new treatment targets through un- derstanding the underlying pathophysiological mecha- nisms. Research should be directed toward the development of therapies that directly counteract the mechanisms accounting for the development of hyper- tension and disease progression. Additional research aimed at development of practical approaches to imple- mentation of clinical and population-based strategies to prevent obesity, increase physical ﬁtness, and control excess salt and sugar intake could have signiﬁcant public h e a l t hi m p a c t .I na d d i t i o n ,t h e r ea r em i n i m a l ,i fa n y ,d a t a on whether treatment of hypertension during pregnancy mitigates risk; thus, there is a need for further research in this area, considering both p r o x i m a t e( d u r i n gt h ep r e g - nancy and postpartum period) and distant (CVD preven- tion) outcomes (S15-1) . I nt h ev e r yo l d ,f r a i l t ya n dh i g h e rr i s ko fm e d i c a t i o n side effects complicate treatment. Additional knowledge of the effects of antihypertensive treatment for patients with dementia and patients who reside in long-term-care facility settings is needed. The best approach to older persons who have supine hypertension but postural hypotension needs to be clariﬁed. Further research related to shared decision-making with patients and their fa milies is needed. Examples i n c l u d ea r e a sw h e r ee v i d e n c ed o e sn o tc l e a r l yi d e n t i f y one treatment or goal as substantially better than another, where improved patient knowledge (or improved provider knowledge of the patient ’sc i r c u m - stances) might improve compliance, where reliance on patient collaboration improv es achievement of outcomes (e.g., HBPM, use of social media), and where there are competing health concerns (e.g., older individuals with frailty). Finally, clinical guidelines are increasingly required to manage the large body of accumulated knowledge related to diagnosis and management of high BP. However, guidelines often cause controversy and confusion when competing recommendations are made by different “expert ” groups or when changes in de ﬁnitions, treat- ments, or treatment goals are introduced. Now may be the time to begin the investigation of the impact of guidelines on clinical practice, costs, and patient outcomes, as well as ways to facilitate communication and collaboration between different guideline- developing organizations. This document is, as its name implies, a guide. In man- aging patients, the responsible clinician ’sj u d g m e n tr e - mains paramount.
