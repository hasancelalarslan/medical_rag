The prevalence of sedentary behavior, hyperuricemia, and gout is increasing worldwide. However, the relationships between sedentary behavior and the risk of hyperuricemia and gout in American adults remain unclear. Therefore, we aim to investigate the association between sedentary behavior and the risk of hyperuricemia and gout. Adults aged â¥ 20 years from the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed, with sedentary time assessed via questionnaires and serum uric acid levels measured through laboratory tests. Gout was confirmed by a physician or health professional. Hyperuricemia was defined as a serum uric acid level of â¥ 7.0 mg/dL in men and â¥ 5.7 mg/dL in women. Weighted logistic regression models and restricted cubic spline analyses were used to examine the associations between sedentary time and hyperuricemia and gout. Mediation analysis was used to explore the potential mediating role of hyperuricemia. A total of 17,634 participants were included in the analysis. The prevalence of hyperuricemia was 20.24% (3569/17,634), and gout was 4.11% (725/17,634). After adjusting for multiple covariates, weighted logistic regression indicated that higher sedentary time (\u003e 8 h/day) was associated with increased risk of hyperuricemia and gout, with adjusted odds ratios (OR) of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.39) and 1.41 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.93), respectively. Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a nonlinear association between sedentary time and the risks of hyperuricemia and gout. Subgroup analyses showed that chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage (P = 0.012) and sex (P = 0.04) modified the association between sedentary time and hyperuricemia, while sex alone modified the association with gout (P = 0.04). The results of the sensitivity analyses remained robust. The results of the mediation analysis showed that hyperuricemia played a mediating role between sedentary time and gout, with a mediation proportion of 15.93%. Sedentary time increases the risk of hyperuricemia and gout in US adults, especially in men and those with advanced CKD, with hyperuricemia acting as a key mediator. Key Points â¢ Sedentary time of more than 8 h per day is significantly associated with an 18% increased risk of hyperuricemia and a 41% increased risk of gout, compared to less than 4 h per day among US adults. â¢ The association between sedentary time and hyperuricemia is more pronounced among males and individuals with advanced stages of chronic kidney disease, while the association with gout is significantly modified by sex, with a stronger effect observed in males. â¢ Hyperuricemia plays a mediating role between sedentary time and gout, with a mediation proportion of 15.93%."",""score"":0.5055963397026062,""source"":""pubmed:40758258"",""meta"":{""id"":""40758258"",""text"":""Association between sedentary behavior, hyperuricemia, and gout in American adults: a nationally representative cross-sectional study..

The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases were searched through 12 July 2024. The primary outcomes were asthma and pneumonia, and the secondary outcomes were pulmonary fibrosis (PF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, interstitial lung disease (ILD), bronchiectasis, bronchitis, acute lung injury (ALI), pulmonary embolism, pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTMPD).

The pooled results indicated that GERD was significantly linked to an increased incidence of asthma (OR = 1.50, P \u003c 0.001) and pneumonia (OR = 1.53, P \u003c 0.001), as did PF (OR = 1.43, P = 0.001), COPD (OR = 1.41, P = 0.004), lung cancer (OR = 1.51, P \u003c 0.001), ILD (OR = 1.28, P = 0.015), bronchiectasis (OR = 1.63, P = 0.039), bronchitis (OR = 1.24, P \u003c 0.001), ALI (OR = 2.07, P \u003c 0.001), pulmonary embolism (OR = 1.33, P = 0.013), PTB (OR = 1.63, P = 0.015) and NTMPD (OR = 3.36, P \u003c 0.001).

The pooled results indicated that GERD was significantly linked to an increased incidence of asthma (OR = 1.50, P \u003c 0.001) and pneumonia (OR = 1.53, P \u003c 0.001), as did PF (OR = 1.43, P = 0.001), COPD (OR = 1.41, P = 0.004), lung cancer (OR = 1.51, P \u003c 0.001), ILD (OR = 1.28, P = 0.015), bronchiectasis (OR = 1.63, P = 0.039), bronchitis (OR = 1.24, P \u003c 0.001), ALI (OR = 2.07, P \u003c 0.001), pulmonary embolism (OR = 1.33, P = 0.013), PTB (OR = 1.63, P = 0.015) and NTMPD (OR = 3.36, P \u003c 0.001). Subgroup analyses stratified by age and source of OR yielded similar results. However, no significant associations between treated GERD and the incidence of asthma (OR = 1.27, P = 0.081) or lung cancer (OR = 1.01, P = 0.97) were observed. The presence of GERD is associated with an increased incidence of subsequent various pulmonary diseases, but regular treatment may eliminate this effect. These findings highlight the importance of screening and management for pulmonary diseases and of standardized therapy in patients with GERD.

The number of COPD exacerbations experienced during the baseline period (ie, the exposure variable) was used to categorise patients into the following groups: no exacerbations, one moderate exacerbation only or two or more moderate/severe exacerbations. Outcomes assessed included risk of COPD exacerbations and all-cause mortality during follow-up as a function of baseline exacerbations. For meta-analyses, all rate ratios (RRs) were log-transformed, and associations were pooled across studies using random-effects meta-analysis models.

A committee of experts developed a 60-item questionnaire to be agreed by a panel of experts, categorized into seven sections. After two rounds, consensus was reached on 81.7% of the items. Strong consensus (more than 85%) was reached on the importance of implementing protocols to help patients with exacerbations in both outpatient (92.7%) and inpatient (94.3%) settings. Regarding the criteria for hospitalization due to an exacerbation, respondents agreed that they are clearly defined (75.5%). Regarding bronchodilator use for CES, the only statement that did not achieve agreement was whether there are clinical differences between the use of nebulized rescue bronchodilators and pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) with a spacer. Regarding CES treatment in the outpatient setting, consensus was reached for almost all statements, in contrast to what was found for inpatient treatment. Respondents disagreed with the statement that the use of SABA should be accompanied by the discontinuation of LAMAs or LABAs, with or without corticosteroids (74.8%).

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the diversity and frequency of symptoms in NAID and compare with anemic cases and explore the association of symptoms with biomarkers. This retrospective and cross-sectional study was conducted on female patients at a university hospital. Patients admitted to the iron deficiency outpatient clinic between March 2021 and August 2022 were analyzed. Patients aged 18 years and older with iron deficiency (ferritin \u003c 30 mcg/L) were included. Iron parameters, hemoglobin levels, and symptoms were included into the dataset, and these independent variables were compared between patient groups categorized as NAID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The study sample consisted of 239 patients. The frequencies of IDA and NAID were 70.3% (n = 168) and 29.7% (n = 71), respectively. Forty-one distinct symptoms or symptom groups were documented, ranging from neuropsychiatric to gastrointestinal manifestations. The mean number of symptoms per person was 16.5 (7.03). The top ten most common symptoms were weakness (87.03%), fatigue (82.43%), easy fatigability (78.66%), amnesia (72.38%), feeling cold (71.55%), alopecia (70.29%), cold intolerance (69.04%), sleep problems (66.53%), nervosity (63.18%), and cold foot (59.83%). The IDA group had more diverse symptoms than the NAID group (P \u003c.05). Most of the forty-one symptoms or symptom groups were similar in frequency in the IDA and NAID groups. Only palpitations, cold intolerance, easy fatigability, and unclassifiable group differed between the groups (P \u003c.05). The highest correlation between iron parameters and symptom diversity was transferrin saturation (TSAT) (r=-.229, P \u003c.001). All but three of the positive symptoms showed TSAT levels below 8%. This study confirms that anemia is not a prerequisite for the majority of iron deficiency symptoms, which are common in non-anemic women. TSAT demonstrates a robust correlation, underscoring its potential as an early diagnostic biomarker. Clinicians must acknowledge various non-specific symptoms irrespective of anemia.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive and systemic autoimmune disease, characterized by a chronic inflammatory process, affecting the lining of the synovial joints, many body organs/systems, and blood vessels. Its pathological hallmarks are hyperplasic synovium, bone erosion, and progressive joint destruction. Rheumatoid arthritis affects over 20 million people, with a worldwide prevalence of 0.5-1.0%, exhibiting gender, ethnic, and geographical differences. The progressive disability severely impairs physical motion and quality of life and is finally leading to a shortened life span. The pathogenesis of RA is a complex and still poorly understood process in which genetic and environmental factors are principally associated. Current treatment mostly relies on conventional/non-biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs), analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, steroids, immunosuppresants, and biologic DMARDs, which only control inflammation and pain. Along with side effects (drug toxicity and intolerance), these anti-rheumatic drugs possess limited efficacy. Therefore, the discovery of novel multi-target therapeutics with an improved safety profile that function as inhibitors of RA-linked signaling systems are in high demand, and this is in the interest of both patients and clinicians.

Among the unproven GERD group, 23 (31.5%) had GERD and 50 (68.5%) had an E-DGBI. Functional dyspepsia (70.6%) and irritable bowel syndrome (33.6%) were highly prevalent. No difference was found in symptom presentation, anxiety, depression, and visceral sensitivity scores. A higher acid exposure time and number of reflux episodes were found in patients with confirmed refractory GERD compared with the overlap E-DGBI-GERD group. E-DGBIs are highly prevalent in patients with proven GERD and refractory reflux symptoms. Studies with outcome data are needed to determine whether patients with overlapping E-DGBIs and GERD should be identified with pH-impedance monitoring on PPI therapy before an interventional treatment option is considered."",""source"":""pubmed:40402176""}},{""text"":""The Mid-term Efficacy of Sleeve-Nissen Versus Sleeve-Toupet Fundoplication for the Management of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease in Patients with Obesity..

We conducted a retrospective cohort study at three U.S. healthcare systems during 2010-2018. Females aged 21-38 years with an abnormal cervical cancer screening test result for which colposcopy was guideline-recommended were included. We estimated age-specific PPVs of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe diagnosis (â¥ CIN 2) in HPV-vaccinated and unvaccinated females.

Parkinson\u0027s disease (PD) is now recognized as a multisystem, heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease with fluctuating trajectories and complex symptom profiles. Despite therapeutic advances, many patients (particularly women and those in late stages) and their caregivers face substantial unmet needs across physical, psychological, social, and spiritual domains, which highlight the need for a more integrative care model. Palliative care, defined as holistic, person-centered care for individuals with life-limiting illnesses, is increasingly recognized as particularly relevant in PD, from early to terminal stages. However, its implementation in neurology remains limited, notably due to persistent misconceptions, and delayed or absent referrals.

Parkinson\u0027s disease (PD) is now recognized as a multisystem, heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease with fluctuating trajectories and complex symptom profiles. Despite therapeutic advances, many patients (particularly women and those in late stages) and their caregivers face substantial unmet needs across physical, psychological, social, and spiritual domains, which highlight the need for a more integrative care model. Palliative care, defined as holistic, person-centered care for individuals with life-limiting illnesses, is increasingly recognized as particularly relevant in PD, from early to terminal stages. However, its implementation in neurology remains limited, notably due to persistent misconceptions, and delayed or absent referrals.

Our previous research suggested that antiemetic efficacy might be higher in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) compared to those without DM because of cortisol and substance P. To further investigate this, the current study analyzed which comorbidities affected chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with esophageal cancer treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This retrospective study enrolled Japanese patients with esophageal cancer who received fluorouracil and cisplatin (FP) combination chemotherapy as their initial treatment. The primary endpoint was the total control (TC) rate during the first cycle, defined as no emetic episodes, no nausea, and no rescue medication use over the overall period (0-120 h) measured by patients\u0027 diary or medical staff interview. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze the TC rate, including previously reported risk factors (age, sex, performance status, body mass index, cisplatin dose, and number of prophylactic antiemetic agents). Comorbidities showing significance in the univariate analysis were further assessed in the multivariate analysis. The significance level was set at 5%. Among the 285 eligible patients, the prevalence of comorbidities was as follows: hypertension (36.8%), DM (17.9%), cardiovascular disease (10.6%), and hyperlipidemia (9.5%).

We included participants aged 65 years or older with hypertension from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) years 1999-2018 to analyze the adherence to lifestyle recommendations and the control of cardiovascular risk factors. Recommended lifestyle behaviors and targets for cardiovascular risk factor controls were defined according to the clinical guidelines for the management of hypertension. Logistic regression analyses were utilized to identify factors associated with nonadherence. Of 10,162 participants (mean age, 74.45 years) included, 4350 (42.81%) had controlled blood pressure. Adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors varied among respondents. Smoking cessation (88.82%) and alcohol reduction (74.11%) were relatively high, whereas adherence to physical activity (14.57%), low salt diet (36.81%), and fiber intake (12.87%) were significantly lower. A significant proportion of respondents achieved target levels for LDL-C (76.00%) and HbA1c (72.49%), whereas fewer participants met BMI (25.02%) and waist circumference (31.26%) goals for cardiovascular risk factor control.

Self-management of hypertension is particularly emphasized for older patients. Specifically, it is critical that initiatives regarding lifestyle modifications be applied to reduce the cardiovascular burden of hypertension among the elderly population. We included participants aged 65 years or older with hypertension from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) years 1999-2018 to analyze the adherence to lifestyle recommendations and the control of cardiovascular risk factors. Recommended lifestyle behaviors and targets for cardiovascular risk factor controls were defined according to the clinical guidelines for the management of hypertension. Logistic regression analyses were utilized to identify factors associated with nonadherence. Of 10,162 participants (mean age, 74.45 years) included, 4350 (42.81%) had controlled blood pressure. Adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors varied among respondents. Smoking cessation (88.82%) and alcohol reduction (74.11%) were relatively high, whereas adherence to physical activity (14.57%), low salt diet (36.81%), and fiber intake (12.87%) were significantly lower. A significant proportion of respondents achieved target levels for LDL-C (76.00%) and HbA1c (72.49%), whereas fewer participants met BMI (25.02%) and waist circumference (31.26%) goals for cardiovascular risk factor control.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating condition of unknown cause that results in progressive, irreversible scarring of the lung, manifesting as breathlessness and dry cough. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is thought to be responsible for as many as 1 in 100 deaths in the United Kingdom, killing 5300 people a year. Ambulatory oxygen therapy is commonly used in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis to relieve exertional breathlessness, although evidence to support this strategy is lacking. This pragmatic randomised controlled trial was planned to test whether use of ambulatory oxygen therapy is beneficial in people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We planned a randomised controlled trial in 260 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who are breathless on exertion and do not meet criteria for long-term oxygen therapy, randomising in a 1 : 1 ratio between ambulatory oxygen therapy and best supportive care. Primary outcome was a quality-of-life questionnaire validated in pulmonary fibrosis, the King\u0027s Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire, measured at 6 months. We calculated our sample size based on the minimum clinically important difference of four units and standard deviation equal to 8.85 in King\u0027s Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire; assuming power of 90% and 5% two-sided significance level, thus required 130 per arm, after accounting for 20% dropout. The trials unit\u0027s web-based randomisation algorithm minimises on factors potentially influencing response to ambulatory oxygen therapy, such as severity of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, desaturation to \u003c 88% present on walking, current or recent (within 6 months) pulmonary rehabilitation, and recruitment centre. Secondary outcomes included symptoms, exercise capacity and cost-effectiveness. A process evaluation included assessment of trial fidelity and acceptability of the intervention with use of qualitative research methods and arts approaches with patients and staff. Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients from the Ambulatory Oxygen for Pulmonary Fibrosis trial and the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patient support group Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis, and stakeholders: healthcare professionals and policy-makers. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed clean verbatim. Photovoice methodology was conducted with patients. A workshop prior to data collection informed and guided data collection and analysis. Traditional qualitative analysis and arts-based coproduction analysis approaches were used to produce a short film. An economic model was planned but could not occur due to early termination. The trial was stopped prematurely due to low recruitment. This was due to a combination of the impact of COVID-19 on research infrastructure, financial issues for sites with the payment structure for the trial and lack of equipoise which limited site recruitment. Seven out of 25 eligible, interested patients were randomised after pre-screening, implying a lack of interest among patients in the study. Baseline characteristics indicated that patients were elderly (mean age 81) and predominantly male. Qualitative work with 11 patients and 23 other stakeholders concluded that ambulatory oxygen therapy is desirable, acceptable and widely commissioned in the United Kingdom, such that further trials are not likely to be feasible. Although we are not able to formally address our objectives of assessing efficacy and cost-effectiveness of ambulatory oxygen therapy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, it is unlikely that conducting a randomised controlled trial is feasible due to lack of equipoise. This synopsis presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme as award number NIHR131149. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is responsible for as many as 1 in 100 deaths in the UK, killing 5300 people a year. Initially, sufferers notice shortness of breath and a persistent dry cough. As a result of breathlessness, patients reduce their physical activity; even basic tasks, such as washing, dressing and eating, can become difficult. Treatment may include exercise programmes (pulmonary rehabilitation), and tablets designed to reduce processes in the lung which lead to scarring (antifibrotics). Increasing breathlessness can happen as a result of low oxygen levels, especially when trying to be active; it can even occur when oxygen levels are normal. There has been very little research into how to treat low oxygen levels for those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; so far, there is no evidence as to whether using oxygen just for walking (ambulatory oxygen treatment) is helpful. This study planned to assess whether or not ambulatory oxygen therapy helped people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. To test this, we designed a randomised controlled trial for 260 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients who were breathless when walking. We had difficulty finding centres and patients to participate; therefore, the trial stopped early, with only seven participants. These difficulties were affected by the impact of COVID-19 on conducting research across the country and unexpected financial issues relating to how treatment was delivered from different centres. However, interviews with people not participating in the study suggested the study would be unappealing to patients and healthcare professionals regardless of other factors. Analysis of data from 37 interviews (patients, clinicians and commissioners) concluded that ambulatory oxygen therapy was acceptable and widely (perhaps universally) available.

Approximately 5% of patients with asthma have severe disease. Treatment escalation may occur despite symptoms not being due to asthma, leading to comorbidities occurring. To explore factors associated with treatment escalation to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA): step 4/5 in patients with asthma. A nested case-control study of patients with asthma from the Optimum Patient Care Research Database. Study 1: patients who transitioned from GINA: steps 2/3 to steps 4/5 were compared with matched controls (GINA: step 2/3). Study 2: patients who transitioned from step 4 to step 5 were compared with matched controls (step 4). Study 1: Step 4/5 cases (n = 12,780) were older, obese, predominantly female, more comorbid (â¥2) with increased exacerbations versus step 2/3 controls (n = 31,974) (P \u003c .001). Exacerbations increased nearing treatment escalation in cases but not controls. Study 2: There was no difference in age, sex, or obesity levels in step 5 cases (n = 12,780) versus step 4 controls (n = 31,974). Cases were more comorbid (â¥2) (54.0% vs 44.3%, P = .001), with increased mood disorder levels (depression/anxiety) (21.0% vs 13.7%, P = .002) and more exacerbations (81.4% vs 34.3%, P \u003c .001), versus controls. Exacerbations and mood disorder were associated with treatment escalation (P \u003c .001).

This narrative review synthesizes quantitative and qualitative research, including observational and randomized clinical studies, as well as review articles, to place issues of EPC within the context of AML. This overview details our Medline English literature search from January 2010 to June 2025. A systematic search on PubMed was conducted in two phases: March-April 2025 and June 2025. We used several keywords, including AML, EOL care, EPC, PC, QoL, and symptom relief. Furthermore, we reviewed https://clinicaltrials.gov/ (last accessed June 30, 2025) and conducted manual searches of references to ensure the completeness of our findings. Additionally, we obtained expert insights through discussions with specialists in AML and PC. The key agendas of PC are symptom control, emotional support, and quality communication along the painful process of AML diagnosis and treatment. In this instance, patients who receive EPC experience a reduction in pain, anxiety, and depression compared to when patients are under standard care (SC), not supplemented with EPC. Additionally, integrating EPC is capable of enhancing patient-practitioner communication because it allows them to select the most appropriate treatment, ideally suited to the specific needs and experience of the patient. The results of our review highlighted the evolving AML landscape, where novel therapies are now in practice, and numerous others are in development. Therefore, newer, reduced-intensity regimens can provide a duration of disease control but not remission.

Thus, decision-making with treating physicians and initial treatment to control symptoms, together with psychological counseling, are integral parts of AML treatment, aiming to achieve greater satisfaction and better emotional well-being in patients and caregivers."",""source"":""pubmed:40769734""}}]"

To investigate the associations between national breast cancer screening programmes and breast cancer mortality globally. We collected data on breast cancer screening programmes and breast cancer mortality from the World Health Organization\u0027s Global Health Observatory, the Global Burden of Diseases 2021 study and the Eurostat database. We assessed differences in breast cancer mortality between countries with regular and irregular screening programmes, adjusting for sociodemographic index. We calculated annual changes in breast cancer mortality from 2015 to 2021 and assessed differences in mortality changes between countries with regular and irregular screening programmes. Between 2015 and 2021, 94 of 194 countries reported having national breast cancer screening programmes. In 2021, countries with regular breast cancer screening programmes had 3.74 fewer deaths (95% uncertainty interval, UI: 1.69-5.81) per 100 000 population than countries with irregular screening programmes. This difference was more pronounced in women aged 50-74 years: 10.13 fewer deaths (95% UI: 4.47-15.80) per 100 000. From 2015 to 2021, the age-standardized mortality rate decreased by 1.02% (95% UI: 0.71-1.36) annually in countries with regular breast cancer screening programmes, whereas countries with irregular programmes had an annual increase of 0.45% (95% UI: 0.23-0.69). Higher breast cancer screening coverage rates were associated with lower mortality in the European region. Countries with breast cancer screening programmes had a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality. Reducing breast cancer mortality globally will require adopting national breast cancer screening programmes and increasing screening coverage, particularly among women aged 50-74 years. Ãtudier les associations entre les programmes nationaux de dÃ©pistage du cancer du sein et la mortalitÃ© due Ã  cette maladie Ã  lâÃ©chelle mondiale. Nous avons recueilli des donnÃ©es sur les programmes de dÃ©pistage du cancer du sein et la mortalitÃ© due Ã  cette maladie auprÃ¨s de lâObservatoire mondial de la SantÃ© de lâOrganisation mondiale de la SantÃ©, de lâÃ©tude Global Burden of Diseases 2021 et de la base de donnÃ©es dâEurostat. Nous avons Ã©valuÃ© les diffÃ©rences de mortalitÃ© due au cancer du sein entre les pays ayant mis en place des programmes de dÃ©pistage rÃ©guliers et ceux disposant de programmes irrÃ©guliers, en tenant compte de lâindice sociodÃ©mographique. Nous avons calculÃ© les variations annuelles de la mortalitÃ© due au cancer du sein entre 2015 et 2021 et Ã©valuÃ© les diffÃ©rences de variations de la mortalitÃ© entre les pays disposant de programmes de dÃ©pistage rÃ©guliers et irrÃ©guliers. Entre 2015 et 2021, 94 pays sur 194 ont dÃ©clarÃ© avoir mis en place des programmes nationaux de dÃ©pistage du cancer du sein. En 2021, ceux qui ont implÃ©mentÃ© des programmes rÃ©guliers comptaient 3,74 dÃ©cÃ¨s de moins (intervalle dâincertitude Ã  95%: 1,69â5,81) pour 100 000 femmes que les pays ayant des programmes de dÃ©pistage irrÃ©guliers. Cette diffÃ©rence Ã©tait plus prononcÃ©e chez les femmes de 50 Ã  74 ans: 10,13 dÃ©cÃ¨s en moins (intervalle dâincertitude Ã  95%: 4,47â15,80) par 100 000 femmes. Entre 2015 et 2021, le taux de mortalitÃ© standardisÃ© selon lâÃ¢ge a diminuÃ© chaque annÃ©e de 1,02% (intervalle dâincertitude Ã  95%: 0,71â1,36) dans les pays disposant de programmes rÃ©guliers de dÃ©pistage du cancer du sein, tandis que ceux ayant mis en place des programmes irrÃ©guliers ont connu une augmentation annuelle de 0,45% (intervalle dâincertitude Ã  95%: 0,23â0,69). Des taux de couverture plus Ã©levÃ©s pour le dÃ©pistage du cancer du sein Ã©taient associÃ©s Ã  une mortalitÃ© plus faible dans la rÃ©gion de lâEurope. Les pays disposant de programmes de dÃ©pistage du cancer du sein ont enregistrÃ© une rÃ©duction significative de la mortalitÃ© due au cancer du sein. Pour rÃ©duire ce taux Ã  lâÃ©chelle mondiale, il faudra adopter des programmes nationaux de dÃ©pistage du cancer du sein et augmenter la couverture du dÃ©pistage, en particulier chez les femmes de 50 Ã  74 ans. Investigar la asociaciÃ³n entre los programas nacionales de cribado de cÃ¡ncer de mama y la mortalidad por esta causa a nivel mundial. Se recopilaron datos sobre programas de cribado de cÃ¡ncer de mama y mortalidad por cÃ¡ncer de mama del Observatorio Mundial de la Salud de la OrganizaciÃ³n Mundial de la Salud, del estudio Entre 2015 y 2021, 94 de 194 paÃ­ses informaron tener programas nacionales de cribado de cÃ¡ncer de mama. En 2021, los paÃ­ses con programas regulares de cribado de cÃ¡ncer de mama registraron 3,74 muertes menos (intervalo de incertidumbre del 95%, UI: 1,69 a 5,81) por cada 100 000 habitantes en comparaciÃ³n con aquellos con programas irregulares. Esta diferencia fue mÃ¡s pronunciada en las mujeres de 50 a 74 aÃ±os: 10,13 muertes menos (UI del 95%: 4,47 a 15,80) por cada 100 000. Entre 2015 y 2021, la tasa de mortalidad estandarizada por edad disminuyÃ³ un 1,02% anual (UI del 95%: 0,71 a 1,36) en los paÃ­ses con programas regulares de cribado, mientras que en los paÃ­ses con programas irregulares se observÃ³ un aumento anual del 0,45% (UI del 95%: 0,23 a 0,69). Se observÃ³ una asociaciÃ³n entre mayores tasas de cobertura del cribado y menor mortalidad en la RegiÃ³n Europea. Los paÃ­ses con programas de cribado de cÃ¡ncer de mama presentaron una reducciÃ³n significativa en la mortalidad por esta causa. La disminuciÃ³n global de la mortalidad por cÃ¡ncer de mama requerirÃ¡ la adopciÃ³n de programas nacionales de cribado y el aumento de la cobertura, especialmente entre las mujeres de 50 a 74 aÃ±os.

To investigate the associations between national breast cancer screening programmes and breast cancer mortality globally. We collected data on breast cancer screening programmes and breast cancer mortality from the World Health Organization\u0027s Global Health Observatory, the Global Burden of Diseases 2021 study and the Eurostat database. We assessed differences in breast cancer mortality between countries with regular and irregular screening programmes, adjusting for sociodemographic index. We calculated annual changes in breast cancer mortality from 2015 to 2021 and assessed differences in mortality changes between countries with regular and irregular screening programmes. Between 2015 and 2021, 94 of 194 countries reported having national breast cancer screening programmes. In 2021, countries with regular breast cancer screening programmes had 3.74 fewer deaths (95% uncertainty interval, UI: 1.69-5.81) per 100 000 population than countries with irregular screening programmes. This difference was more pronounced in women aged 50-74 years: 10.13 fewer deaths (95% UI: 4.47-15.80) per 100 000. From 2015 to 2021, the age-standardized mortality rate decreased by 1.02% (95% UI: 0.71-1.36) annually in countries with regular breast cancer screening programmes, whereas countries with irregular programmes had an annual increase of 0.45% (95% UI: 0.23-0.69). Higher breast cancer screening coverage rates were associated with lower mortality in the European region. Countries with breast cancer screening programmes had a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality. Reducing breast cancer mortality globally will require adopting national breast cancer screening programmes and increasing screening coverage, particularly among women aged 50-74 years. Ãtudier les associations entre les programmes nationaux de dÃ©pistage du cancer du sein et la mortalitÃ© due Ã  cette maladie Ã  lâÃ©chelle mondiale. Nous avons recueilli des donnÃ©es sur les programmes de dÃ©pistage du cancer du sein et la mortalitÃ© due Ã  cette maladie auprÃ¨s de lâObservatoire mondial de la SantÃ© de lâOrganisation mondiale de la SantÃ©, de lâÃ©tude Global Burden of Diseases 2021 et de la base de donnÃ©es dâEurostat. Nous avons Ã©valuÃ© les diffÃ©rences de mortalitÃ© due au cancer du sein entre les pays ayant mis en place des programmes de dÃ©pistage rÃ©guliers et ceux disposant de programmes irrÃ©guliers, en tenant compte de lâindice sociodÃ©mographique. Nous avons calculÃ© les variations annuelles de la mortalitÃ© due au cancer du sein entre 2015 et 2021 et Ã©valuÃ© les diffÃ©rences de variations de la mortalitÃ© entre les pays disposant de programmes de dÃ©pistage rÃ©guliers et irrÃ©guliers. Entre 2015 et 2021, 94 pays sur 194 ont dÃ©clarÃ© avoir mis en place des programmes nationaux de dÃ©pistage du cancer du sein. En 2021, ceux qui ont implÃ©mentÃ© des programmes rÃ©guliers comptaient 3,74 dÃ©cÃ¨s de moins (intervalle dâincertitude Ã  95%: 1,69â5,81) pour 100 000 femmes que les pays ayant des programmes de dÃ©pistage irrÃ©guliers. Cette diffÃ©rence Ã©tait plus prononcÃ©e chez les femmes de 50 Ã  74 ans: 10,13 dÃ©cÃ¨s en moins (intervalle dâincertitude Ã  95%: 4,47â15,80) par 100 000 femmes. Entre 2015 et 2021, le taux de mortalitÃ© standardisÃ© selon lâÃ¢ge a diminuÃ© chaque annÃ©e de 1,02% (intervalle dâincertitude Ã  95%: 0,71â1,36) dans les pays disposant de programmes rÃ©guliers de dÃ©pistage du cancer du sein, tandis que ceux ayant mis en place des programmes irrÃ©guliers ont connu une augmentation annuelle de 0,45% (intervalle dâincertitude Ã  95%: 0,23â0,69). Des taux de couverture plus Ã©levÃ©s pour le dÃ©pistage du cancer du sein Ã©taient associÃ©s Ã  une mortalitÃ© plus faible dans la rÃ©gion de lâEurope. Les pays disposant de programmes de dÃ©pistage du cancer du sein ont enregistrÃ© une rÃ©duction significative de la mortalitÃ© due au cancer du sein. Pour rÃ©duire ce taux Ã  lâÃ©chelle mondiale, il faudra adopter des programmes nationaux de dÃ©pistage du cancer du sein et augmenter la couverture du dÃ©pistage, en particulier chez les femmes de 50 Ã  74 ans. Investigar la asociaciÃ³n entre los programas nacionales de cribado de cÃ¡ncer de mama y la mortalidad por esta causa a nivel mundial. Se recopilaron datos sobre programas de cribado de cÃ¡ncer de mama y mortalidad por cÃ¡ncer de mama del Observatorio Mundial de la Salud de la OrganizaciÃ³n Mundial de la Salud, del estudio Entre 2015 y 2021, 94 de 194 paÃ­ses informaron tener programas nacionales de cribado de cÃ¡ncer de mama. En 2021, los paÃ­ses con programas regulares de cribado de cÃ¡ncer de mama registraron 3,74 muertes menos (intervalo de incertidumbre del 95%, UI: 1,69 a 5,81) por cada 100 000 habitantes en comparaciÃ³n con aquellos con programas irregulares. Esta diferencia fue mÃ¡s pronunciada en las mujeres de 50 a 74 aÃ±os: 10,13 muertes menos (UI del 95%: 4,47 a 15,80) por cada 100 000. Entre 2015 y 2021, la tasa de mortalidad estandarizada por edad disminuyÃ³ un 1,02% anual (UI del 95%: 0,71 a 1,36) en los paÃ­ses con programas regulares de cribado, mientras que en los paÃ­ses con programas irregulares se observÃ³ un aumento anual del 0,45% (UI del 95%: 0,23 a 0,69). Se observÃ³ una asociaciÃ³n entre mayores tasas de cobertura del cribado y menor mortalidad en la RegiÃ³n Europea.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive and systemic autoimmune disease, characterized by a chronic inflammatory process, affecting the lining of the synovial joints, many body organs/systems, and blood vessels. Its pathological hallmarks are hyperplasic synovium, bone erosion, and progressive joint destruction. Rheumatoid arthritis affects over 20 million people, with a worldwide prevalence of 0.5-1.0%, exhibiting gender, ethnic, and geographical differences. The progressive disability severely impairs physical motion and quality of life and is finally leading to a shortened life span. The pathogenesis of RA is a complex and still poorly understood process in which genetic and environmental factors are principally associated. Current treatment mostly relies on conventional/non-biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs), analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, steroids, immunosuppresants, and biologic DMARDs, which only control inflammation and pain. Along with side effects (drug toxicity and intolerance), these anti-rheumatic drugs possess limited efficacy.

We included 24,665 women with ASCVD - 14,419 with CAD, 5,427 with CVD, and 4,819 with PAD. Overall, the median age was 73 (64-81) years. The rates of statin uptake were 50 % for women with CAD, 60 % for CVD and 28 % for PAD. Statin therapy uptake was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations across all three major types of ASCVD: hazard ratio (HR) 0.88, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.83-0.93, p = 0.001 for CAD, HR 0.87, 95 % CI 0.80-0.94, p = 0.006 for PAD, and HR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.66-0.78, p \u003c 0.001 for CVD.

Based on the type of hospital admission (emergency or elective), patients were divided into two groups: those with DFA and those without DFA (chronic diabetic foot, CDF). The DFA was considered in case of ischemia (acute or chronic), infection and Charcot foot requiring urgent hospitalization. Once discharged, patients were regularly followed as outpatients with the following six-month outcomes: healing; major amputation; mortality; hospital readmission; non-fatal major adverse limb and cardiovascular events (MALCE) including nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, and limb ischemia requiring revascularization. Overall, 141 patients were included.

Sub-optimal management of symptomatic COPD and co-morbidities negatively impacts quality of life, ability to work and survival. Previous trials of healthcare professional-led complex interventions have targeted COPD management, but not also simultaneously targeted the treatment of co-morbidities. Recommendations for complex intervention testing include feasibility studies followed by pilot randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including economic and parallel process evaluations. Following a feasibility study, a Tailored, home-based Intervention for people with COPD and Co-morbidities by generalist prescribing Pharmacists collaborating with Consultant respiratory Physicians (TICC PCP) is undergoing pilot testing. The pilot study aims to recruit at least 70% of invited participants within 4 months; deliver TICC PCP to at least 70% of participants in the intervention arm; retain at least 80% of participants (excluding those who died or developed incapacity before the end of the study) until 21-month data collection; and collect at least 90% of in person data at each study time point. In addition, findings from the economic and process evaluations along with information obtained on the proposed quantitative efficacy outcomes inform on the sample size required for a subsequent definitive RCT will help inform on future research. We describe methods for a multicentre pilot RCT, with parallel economic and qualitative process evaluations of TICC PCP. Set in Glasgow and Edinburgh (Scotland), we plan to recruit 100 people with symptomatic COPD and conduct home-based assessments at baseline and at subsequent three monthly follow up visits over a period of 21 months. Independent researchers will collect extensive health and social care data at recruitment (baseline) before participants are randomised (stratified by site and number of respiratory hospitalisations in the past 12 months), to TICC PCP in addition to usual care (UC), or UC alone. Collected data will include objective and subjective measures of health, healthcare utilisation (including prescribing), home circumstances, health related quality of life, healthcare resource use and intervention costs. Follow up data will be collected three monthly for 21 months.

We will utilise the information obtained from this pilot study, including: the recruitment and retention rates; the sample size required to detect a minimal clinically important difference in the proposed efficacy outcomes of interest; the economic analyses; and process evaluation, to determine whether we should progress to a definitive RCT with parallel process and economic evaluation.

This single-center, institutional review board-approved, retrospective observational study recruited consecutive patients with pancreatic cancer-related pain refractory to conservative treatment who underwent CT-guided cryoneurolysis of the splanchnic nerves. Outcomes included overall pain reduction rate (\u003e 4 pain score units in the VAS pain scores), technical success (successful cryoprobe placement at the level of interest), and opioid usage reduction. Fifty patients were included (mean age 65 Â± 7 years). Overall, clinically relevant pain reduction was achieved in 76% of the patients (38/50). Baseline mean self-reported pain score was 9.52 Â± 0.6 (range 8-10) reduced to a mean value of 4.36 Â± 2.9, 4.23 Â± 3, and 4.43 Â± 3.1 after 1, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Technical success was achieved in 100% (50/50) of the patients. Reduction in opioid analgesia usage was observed in 76% (38/50) of the patients.
