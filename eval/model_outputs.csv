The prevalence of sedentary behavior, hyperuricemia, and gout is increasing worldwide.

Therefore, we aim to investigate the association between sedentary behavior and the risk of hyperuricemia and gout. Adults aged ≥ 20 years from the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed, with sedentary time assessed via questionnaires and serum uric acid levels measured through laboratory tests. Gout was confirmed by a physician or health professional. Hyperuricemia was defined as a serum uric acid level of ≥ 7.0 mg/dL in men and ≥ 5.7 mg/dL in women. Weighted logistic regression models and restricted cubic spline analyses were used to examine the associations between sedentary time and hyperuricemia and gout. Mediation analysis was used to explore the potential mediating role of hyperuricemia. A total of 17,634 participants were included in the analysis. The prevalence of hyperuricemia was 20.24% (3569/17,634), and gout was 4.11% (725/17,634). After adjusting for multiple covariates, weighted logistic regression indicated that higher sedentary time (> 8 h/day) was associated with increased risk of hyperuricemia and gout, with adjusted odds ratios (OR) of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.39) and 1.41 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.93), respectively. Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a nonlinear association between sedentary time and the risks of hyperuricemia and gout. Subgroup analyses showed that chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage (P = 0.012) and sex (P = 0.04) modified the association between sedentary time and hyperuricemia, while sex alone modified the association with gout (P = 0.04).

This systematic review, therefore, aimed at bridging this gap by describing the epidemiology of meningitis in Ghana, including its prevalence, aetiology, and antimicrobial resistance. A comprehensive review of electronic databases, including PubMed and Scopus, was conducted between 2nd and 4th December, 2023, following the established PRISMA guidelines. The search encompassed articles published from 1975 to 2023. With no age limitations on study participants, data extraction was performed on peer-reviewed journal articles reporting primary findings.

A meta-analysis was carried out to determine the pooled estimate of meningitis prevalence in the country.

Among 2 733 162 patients with COPD, one moderate exacerbation was significantly associated with a twofold increased risk of future exacerbations compared with having no exacerbations during baseline, with pooled RRs (95% CIs) of 2.47 (1.47 to 4.14) at 1 year, 2.49 (1.38 to 4.49) at 2 years and 2.38 (1.30 to 4.34) at 3 years postindex. The pooled RR (95% CI) for all-cause mortality was 1.30 (1.05 to 1.62), indicating a 30% increase in risk following one moderate exacerbation versus no exacerbations.

Demographics, latency until AD diagnosis, detailed description of FCD and AD, comorbidities, family history, imaging and fluid biomarkers, cognitive testing, symptom trajectory, and employment status were collected from hospital records. Possible clues for AD among FCD patients were explored by comparing FCD-AD cases against a sample of insidious onset FCD-only patients matched for age at symptom onset. Twelve FCD-AD cases were identified (eight female). All patients had FCD symptoms before or simultaneously with an AD diagnosis (median latency of 2.5 years). Low cognitive scores at baseline, sleep disturbance and/or mood and anxiety disorders were more common in the FCD-AD cases, in comparison with the FCD-only group. Informants' concern, executive, language and/or praxis difficulties, and an increase in repetitions may point to underlying AD. No cases appeared to be a misdiagnosis. Initial relative symptom stability or transient improvement, stressful life events around symptom onset and a family history of cognitive difficulties did not differentiate between FCD patients with or without AD.

Prescription of statins in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is not as firmly established as it is for secondary prevention, even in high-income countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set nine global targets for preventing and controlling noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including a goal that, by 2025, 50% of eligible individuals receive drug therapy and counseling focused on managing cardiovascular disease. Data from countries classified as low- to middle-income countries (LMIC) show that only one in 10 eligible people is being treated with statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Statin utilization for primary prevention in patients with normal cholesterol levels could be even lower, but data from LMIC is lacking. We aimed to study statin prescriptions for primary prevention of ASCVD among Sri Lankans without hyperlipidemia. This was a cross-sectional study conducted in a hospital setting in eight selected medical clinics of secondary/tertiary care hospitals representing eight out of nine highly populated provinces of Sri Lanka from 15th December 2022 to 30th April 2023. Prescriptions of consecutive, consenting adults aged 40-75 years, without prior ACVD or hyperlipidemia but eligible for statin primary prevention according to the recommendations of the American Heart Association (AHA) guideline, were studied. Prescriptions were evaluated for rates and the intensity of statin prescription, stratified by their CVD risk. Data were gathered by interviewing patients using a questionnaire and reviewing medical records. We studied 800 patients eligible for statin primary prevention, with a mean age of 62 ± 8.3 years, of which 247 (30.9%) were men, and 566 (70.8%) had diabetes. According to the ASCVD score classification, 176 (22.0%) were at high risk (score >20%) and 624 (78%) were at moderate risk of cardiovascular (CV) events. Statins were prescribed to 659 (82.4%) patients, but only 12 (6.8%) high-risk patients received high-intensity statins, and 470 (75.3%) moderate-risk patients were on moderate-intensity statins. Moreover, 32 (18.2%) high-risk patients were not prescribed any statins. Overall, 482 (60.3%) patients were on guideline-recommended statin doses. In this research, the rate of statin prescription for primary prevention of ASCVD in Sri Lanka's healthcare system was found to be satisfactory, exceeding the WHO's target of 50% of eligible individuals receiving this drug therapy.

We aimed to study statin prescriptions for primary prevention of ASCVD among Sri Lankans without hyperlipidemia.

Bisquinoline is a privileged pharmacophore in medicinal chemistry due to its diverse biological activities, particularly against infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, leishmania, fungi, bacteria, protozoa, schistosomiasis, and HIV. The success of piperaquine, a bisquinoline-derived antimalarial, has underscored its therapeutic potential, driving interest in its role as a small-molecule probe for targeting critical disease pathways. As drug resistance increases and the need for effective treatments rises, bisquinoline's broad pharmacological profile presents promising drug discovery opportunities. This review explores research on bisquinoline derivatives as anti-infective agents, focusing on synthetic approaches, detailed structure-activity relationships, and therapeutic applications.

Univariate analysis and binary logistic regression were used to investigate the association between the related variables and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Among 142,677 women aged 35-64 years, 787 (0.55%) cervical lesions were detected. Being in the age group of 35-44 years, high or technical secondary school level education, living at higher level regions of economic development, and abnormal leucorrhea were associated with increased risk of cervical lesions. Menopause was found to be protective. Married women with lower socioeconomic status had a lower prevalence of cervical lesions but had a higher prevalence of cervical cancer. Those aged 35-44 years, with high or technical secondary school level education, living at higher level regions of economic development, with abnormal leucorrhea, and who were pre-menopausal were at higher risk for cervical lesions."", ""source"": ""pubmed:40621116""}}, {""text"": ""Swab-based anal cancer screening in men living with HIV: Projected outcomes for different screening algorithms..

Understanding the palliative care journey from the caregivers' perspective is particularly important in the Indian context, as caregivers play a central role from diagnosis to end-of-life care and beyond. This study explores the impact of caregiving on family members of terminally ill patients in India, examining the physical, emotional, psychological, and social challenges they encounter. It unfolds the coping mechanisms and the resilience they develop throughout their caregiving journey while providing insight into their experiences, perceptions, and the complexities of their decision to choose palliative care. The study utilizes a focused ethnographic approach, collecting data from the caregivers of an older gentleman who was diagnosed with terminal alveolar cancer and metastasis along with multimorbidity through three unstructured interviews at different periods of the illness trajectory, coupled with participant observation and field notes. While highlighting caregivers' various stressors, the findings indicate that access to palliative care led to benefits such as alleviating physical burden, professional support, social inclusion, and preparation for loss. However, societal reluctance and stigma toward palliative care were evident, with family caregivers feeling inadequate or a sense of failing their duties by placing their loved one in a palliative care center. Destigmatizing palliative care can foster a more supportive and understanding environment for patients and caregivers. These findings offer insights into the complexities of the caregiving process and can potentially inform future broader investigations in the region.

Understanding the palliative care journey from the caregivers' perspective is particularly important in the Indian context, as caregivers play a central role from diagnosis to end-of-life care and beyond. This study explores the impact of caregiving on family members of terminally ill patients in India, examining the physical, emotional, psychological, and social challenges they encounter. It unfolds the coping mechanisms and the resilience they develop throughout their caregiving journey while providing insight into their experiences, perceptions, and the complexities of their decision to choose palliative care. The study utilizes a focused ethnographic approach, collecting data from the caregivers of an older gentleman who was diagnosed with terminal alveolar cancer and metastasis along with multimorbidity through three unstructured interviews at different periods of the illness trajectory, coupled with participant observation and field notes. While highlighting caregivers' various stressors, the findings indicate that access to palliative care led to benefits such as alleviating physical burden, professional support, social inclusion, and preparation for loss. However, societal reluctance and stigma toward palliative care were evident, with family caregivers feeling inadequate or a sense of failing their duties by placing their loved one in a palliative care center. Destigmatizing palliative care can foster a more supportive and understanding environment for patients and caregivers. These findings offer insights into the complexities of the caregiving process and can potentially inform future broader investigations in the region.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating condition of unknown cause that results in progressive, irreversible scarring of the lung, manifesting as breathlessness and dry cough. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is thought to be responsible for as many as 1 in 100 deaths in the United Kingdom, killing 5300 people a year. Ambulatory oxygen therapy is commonly used in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis to relieve exertional breathlessness, although evidence to support this strategy is lacking. This pragmatic randomised controlled trial was planned to test whether use of ambulatory oxygen therapy is beneficial in people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We planned a randomised controlled trial in 260 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who are breathless on exertion and do not meet criteria for long-term oxygen therapy, randomising in a 1 : 1 ratio between ambulatory oxygen therapy and best supportive care. Primary outcome was a quality-of-life questionnaire validated in pulmonary fibrosis, the King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire, measured at 6 months. We calculated our sample size based on the minimum clinically important difference of four units and standard deviation equal to 8.85 in King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire; assuming power of 90% and 5% two-sided significance level, thus required 130 per arm, after accounting for 20% dropout. The trials unit's web-based randomisation algorithm minimises on factors potentially influencing response to ambulatory oxygen therapy, such as severity of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, desaturation to < 88% present on walking, current or recent (within 6 months) pulmonary rehabilitation, and recruitment centre.

A process evaluation included assessment of trial fidelity and acceptability of the intervention with use of qualitative research methods and arts approaches with patients and staff. Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients from the Ambulatory Oxygen for Pulmonary Fibrosis trial and the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patient support group Action for Pulmonary Fibrosis, and stakeholders: healthcare professionals and policy-makers. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed clean verbatim. Photovoice methodology was conducted with patients. A workshop prior to data collection informed and guided data collection and analysis. Traditional qualitative analysis and arts-based coproduction analysis approaches were used to produce a short film. An economic model was planned but could not occur due to early termination. The trial was stopped prematurely due to low recruitment. This was due to a combination of the impact of COVID-19 on research infrastructure, financial issues for sites with the payment structure for the trial and lack of equipoise which limited site recruitment. Seven out of 25 eligible, interested patients were randomised after pre-screening, implying a lack of interest among patients in the study. Baseline characteristics indicated that patients were elderly (mean age 81) and predominantly male. Qualitative work with 11 patients and 23 other stakeholders concluded that ambulatory oxygen therapy is desirable, acceptable and widely commissioned in the United Kingdom, such that further trials are not likely to be feasible.

Эта разница была сильнее выражена для женщин в возрасте 50–74 лет: смертность меньше на 10,13 случая (95%-й ИН: 4,47–15,80) на 100 000 населения. В период с 2015 по 2021 год стандартизированная по возрасту смертность сократилась на 1,02% (95%-й ИН: 0,71–1,36) в год в странах с программами регулярного скрининга на рак молочной железы, тогда как для стран с программами нерегулярного скрининга наблюдался среднегодовой рост в 0,45% (95%-й ИН: 0,23–0,69). В Европейском регионе более высокая степень охвата скринингом ассоциировалась с меньшей смертностью от рака молочной железы. Для стран, в которых имеются программы скрининга на рак молочной железы, характерно значительное снижение смертности от данного заболевания.

Эта разница была сильнее выражена для женщин в возрасте 50–74 лет: смертность меньше на 10,13 случая (95%-й ИН: 4,47–15,80) на 100 000 населения. В период с 2015 по 2021 год стандартизированная по возрасту смертность сократилась на 1,02% (95%-й ИН: 0,71–1,36) в год в странах с программами регулярного скрининга на рак молочной железы, тогда как для стран с программами нерегулярного скрининга наблюдался среднегодовой рост в 0,45% (95%-й ИН: 0,23–0,69). В Европейском регионе более высокая степень охвата скринингом ассоциировалась с меньшей смертностью от рака молочной железы. Для стран, в которых имеются программы скрининга на рак молочной железы, характерно значительное снижение смертности от данного заболевания.

To investigate the associations between national breast cancer screening programmes and breast cancer mortality globally. We collected data on breast cancer screening programmes and breast cancer mortality from the World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory, the Global Burden of Diseases 2021 study and the Eurostat database. We assessed differences in breast cancer mortality between countries with regular and irregular screening programmes, adjusting for sociodemographic index. We calculated annual changes in breast cancer mortality from 2015 to 2021 and assessed differences in mortality changes between countries with regular and irregular screening programmes. Between 2015 and 2021, 94 of 194 countries reported having national breast cancer screening programmes. In 2021, countries with regular breast cancer screening programmes had 3.74 fewer deaths (95% uncertainty interval, UI: 1.69-5.81) per 100 000 population than countries with irregular screening programmes. This difference was more pronounced in women aged 50-74 years: 10.13 fewer deaths (95% UI: 4.47-15.80) per 100 000. From 2015 to 2021, the age-standardized mortality rate decreased by 1.02% (95% UI: 0.71-1.36) annually in countries with regular breast cancer screening programmes, whereas countries with irregular programmes had an annual increase of 0.45% (95% UI: 0.23-0.69). Higher breast cancer screening coverage rates were associated with lower mortality in the European region. Countries with breast cancer screening programmes had a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality. Reducing breast cancer mortality globally will require adopting national breast cancer screening programmes and increasing screening coverage, particularly among women aged 50-74 years. Étudier les associations entre les programmes nationaux de dépistage du cancer du sein et la mortalité due à cette maladie à l’échelle mondiale. Nous avons recueilli des données sur les programmes de dépistage du cancer du sein et la mortalité due à cette maladie auprès de l’Observatoire mondial de la Santé de l’Organisation mondiale de la Santé, de l’étude Global Burden of Diseases 2021 et de la base de données d’Eurostat. Nous avons évalué les différences de mortalité due au cancer du sein entre les pays ayant mis en place des programmes de dépistage réguliers et ceux disposant de programmes irréguliers, en tenant compte de l’indice sociodémographique. Nous avons calculé les variations annuelles de la mortalité due au cancer du sein entre 2015 et 2021 et évalué les différences de variations de la mortalité entre les pays disposant de programmes de dépistage réguliers et irréguliers. Entre 2015 et 2021, 94 pays sur 194 ont déclaré avoir mis en place des programmes nationaux de dépistage du cancer du sein.

La disminución global de la mortalidad por cáncer de mama requerirá la adopción de programas nacionales de cribado y el aumento de la cobertura, especialmente entre las mujeres de 50 a 74 años. الغرض دراسة العلاقة بين البرامج الوطنية لفحص سرطان الثدي ومعدلات وفيات سرطان الثدي عالميًا. الطريقة قمنا بجمع بيانات حول برامج فحص سرطان الثدي ومعدل الوفيات بسبب سرطان الثدي، من مرصد الصحة العالمي التابع لمنظمة الصحة العالمية، ودراسة العبء العالمي للأمراض لعام 2021، وقاعدة بيانات Eurostat. قمنا بتقييم الاختلافات في وفيات سرطان الثدي بين الدول التي تطبق برامج فحص منتظمة وغير منتظمة، مع مراعاة المؤشر الاجتماعي السكاني. قمنا باحتساب التغيرات السنوية في وفيات سرطان الثدي من عام 2015 إلى عام 2021، وتقييم الاختلافات في تغيرات الوفيات بين الدول التي تطبق برامج فحص منتظمة وغير منتظمة. النتائج بين عامي 2015 و2021، أفادت 94 دولة من أصل 194 دولة بتطبيق برامج فحص وطنية لسرطان الثدي. في عام 2021، شهدت الدول التي لديها برامج منتظمة لفحص سرطان الثدي انخفاضًا في عدد الوفيات بمقدار 3.74 (فاصل عدم الثقة %95: 1.69 إلى 5.81) لكل 100000 نسمة مقارنة بالدول التي لديها برامج فحص غير منتظمة. وكان هذا الاختلاف أكثر وضوحًا لدى النساء اللواتي تتراوح أعمارهن بين 50 و74 عامًا: 10.13 حالات وفاة أقل (فاصل عدم الثقة %95: 4.47 إلى 15.80) لكل 100000 شخص. من عام 2015 إلى عام 2021، انخفض معدل الوفيات الموحد حسب العمر بنسبة %1.02 (فاصل عدم الثقة %95: 0.71 إلى 1.36) سنويًا في الدول التي لديها برامج منتظمة لفحص سرطان الثدي، بينما شهدت الدول التي لديها برامج غير منتظمة زيادة سنوية قدرها %0.45 (فاصل عدم الثقة %95: 0.23 إلى 0.69). ارتبطت معدلات تغطية فحص سرطان الثدي الأعلى بانخفاض معدل الوفيات في المنطقة الأوروبية. الاستنتاج شهدت الدول التي لديها برامج فحص لسرطان الثدي انخفاضًا كبيرًا في وفيات سرطان الثدي. إن خفض معدل الوفيات الناجمة عن سرطان الثدي على مستوى العالم يتطلب اعتماد برامج وطنية لفحص سرطان الثدي وزيادة تغطية الفحص، وخاصة بين النساء في الفئة العمرية من 50 إلى 74 عاماً. 旨在探讨在全球范围内实施国家乳腺癌筛查计划与乳腺癌死亡率之间的关联性。. 我们从世界卫生组织全球卫生观察站、2021 年全球疾病负担研究以及欧盟统计局数据库中收集了关于乳腺癌筛查计划和乳腺癌死亡率的数据。我们评估了实施定期筛查计划与实施非定期筛查计划的国家在乳腺癌死亡率方面的差异，并根据社会人口统计学指数进行了相应调整。我们计算了 2015 年至 2021 年期间在乳腺癌死亡率方面的年度变化，并评估了实施定期筛查计划与实施非定期筛查计划的国家在死亡率变化方面的差异。. 在 2015 年至 2021 年期间，这 194 个国家中有 94 个报告称其实施了国家乳腺癌筛查计划。2021 年，与实施非定期筛查计划的国家相比，实施定期乳腺癌筛查计划的国家每 10 万人中的死亡人数减少了 3.74 例（95% 不确定性区间 (UI)：1.69-5.81）。在年龄介于 50 至 74 岁之间的女性中，这一差异更加明显：每 10 万人中的死亡人数减少了 10.13 例（95% UI：4.47-15.80）。在 2015 年至 2021 年期间，实施定期乳腺癌筛查计划的国家的年龄标化死亡率每年下降 1.02%（95% UI：0.71-1.36），而实施非定期筛查计划的国家的年龄标化死亡率则每年增长 0.45%（95% UI：0.23-0.69）。在欧洲区域，乳腺癌筛查覆盖率越高，则死亡率越低。. 在实施乳腺癌筛查计划的国家中，乳腺癌死亡率显著降低。若要降低全球范围内的乳腺癌死亡率，各国必须落实国家乳腺癌筛查计划并扩大筛查覆盖范围，特别是对于年龄介于 50 至 74 岁之间的女性。. Изучить связь между наличием национальных программ скрининга на рак молочной железы и показателями смертности от данного заболевания в глобальном масштабе. Авторы собрали данные о программах скрининга на рак молочной железы и о показателях смертности от данного заболевания по данным Глобальной обсерватории здравоохранения Всемирной организации здравоохранения, исследования глобального бремени заболеваний за 2021 г. и базы данных Eurostat. Были изучены различия в смертности от рака молочной железы в странах с программами регулярного и нерегулярного скрининга с поправкой на социально-демографические показатели. Авторы рассчитали ежегодные изменения в смертности от рака молочной железы в период между 2015 и 2021 годами и оценили различия в динамике смертности для стран с программами регулярного и нерегулярного скрининга. В период с 2015 по 2021 год 94 из 194 стран сообщили о наличии у них национальных программ скрининга на рак молочной железы. В 2021 году страны с программами регулярного скрининга на рак молочной железы имели на 3,74 случая смерти меньше (95%-й интервал неопределенности, ИН: 1,69–5,81) на 100 000 населения, чем страны с программами нерегулярного скрининга. Эта разница была сильнее выражена для женщин в возрасте 50–74 лет: смертность меньше на 10,13 случая (95%-й ИН: 4,47–15,80) на 100 000 населения. В период с 2015 по 2021 год стандартизированная по возрасту смертность сократилась на 1,02% (95%-й ИН: 0,71–1,36) в год в странах с программами регулярного скрининга на рак молочной железы, тогда как для стран с программами нерегулярного скрининга наблюдался среднегодовой рост в 0,45% (95%-й ИН: 0,23–0,69). В Европейском регионе более высокая степень охвата скринингом ассоциировалась с меньшей смертностью от рака молочной железы. Для стран, в которых имеются программы скрининга на рак молочной железы, характерно значительное снижение смертности от данного заболевания. Снижение показателей смертности от рака молочной железы во всем мире потребует введения национальных программ скрининга и расширения охвата, в частности среди женщин в возрасте 50–74 лет."", ""source"": ""pubmed:40766731""}}, {""text"": ""Factors Determining Women's Attitudes and Knowledge Toward Breast Cancer Screening: A Systematic Review.."", ""score"": 0.6533374190330505, ""source"": ""MED:40648630"", ""meta"": {""id"": ""40648630"", ""text"": ""Factors Determining Women's Attitudes and Knowledge Toward Breast Cancer Screening: A Systematic Review.."", ""source"": ""MED:40648630""}}, {""text"": ""Correcting Decades of Misinformation About Breast Cancer Screening: An Open Letter to Women and Those Who Advise Them About Screening for Breast Cancer.."", ""score"": 0.6424123048782349, ""source"": ""MED:40717373"", ""meta"": {""id"": ""40717373"", ""text"": ""Correcting Decades of Misinformation About Breast Cancer Screening: An Open Letter to Women and Those Who Advise Them About Screening for Breast Cancer.."", ""source"": ""MED:40717373""}}, {""text"": ""Evaluation of screening mammography effectiveness: The IARC recommendations of 2015 need revision.."", ""score"": 0.6369307637214661, ""source"": ""MED:40712255"", ""meta"": {""id"": ""40712255"", ""text"": ""Evaluation of screening mammography effectiveness: The IARC recommendations of 2015 need revision.."", ""source"": ""MED:40712255""}}]"

Patients were categorized by presence of concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting. Within this group, patients were further stratified by indication: coronary artery dissection, coronary artery disease, and heart failure after declamping. A total of 972 patients (mean age 47 years) were included. The 30-day mortality was significantly higher in the coronary artery bypass grafting group [18/119 (15.1%) vs 48/853 (5.6%), P < 0.001], with rates of 8.1% (5/62) for coronary artery dissection, 5.7% (2/35) for coronary artery disease, and 50% (11/22) for heart failure after declamping. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that bypass grafting for heart failure after declamping increased 30-day mortality (odds ratio 3.90, 95% confidence interval 1.07-14.22). Overall, 10-year survival was 82.0%. Landmark analysis revealed that heart failure after declamping patients had non-inferior late survival compared to other subgroups, whereas patients with coronary artery disease exhibited the lowest late survival rate (P = 0.002). Coronary artery bypass grafting for heart failure after declamping significantly increases the risk of 30-day mortality but not long-term mortality.

Independent researchers will collect extensive health and social care data at recruitment (baseline) before participants are randomised (stratified by site and number of respiratory hospitalisations in the past 12 months), to TICC PCP in addition to usual care (UC), or UC alone. Collected data will include objective and subjective measures of health, healthcare utilisation (including prescribing), home circumstances, health related quality of life, healthcare resource use and intervention costs. Follow up data will be collected three monthly for 21 months. The intervention, delivered by NHS Pharmacists visiting participants at home monthly for 6 months, then every 2 months for the next 6 months, involves clinical assessment and intervention at home including prescribing for COPD and co-morbidities. Pharmacists will also assess and help participants to address wider health needs, e.g. appointment attendance and home equipment. Pharmacists will collaborate mainly with consultant respiratory physicians, and General Practitioners. A holistic, 1 year long, individualised home-based intervention for people with symptomatic COPD and co-morbidities may help address unmet health needs. We will utilise the information obtained from this pilot study, including: the recruitment and retention rates; the sample size required to detect a minimal clinically important difference in the proposed efficacy outcomes of interest; the economic analyses; and process evaluation, to determine whether we should progress to a definitive RCT with parallel process and economic evaluation. The trial is registered with the UK Clinical Trials Registry (ISRCTN 43508703)."", ""source"": ""pubmed:40739589""}}, {""text"": ""Transforming Palliative Care for Rural Patients with COPD Through Nurse-Led Models.."", ""score"": 0.5805768966674805, ""source"": ""pubmed:40724712"", ""meta"": {""id"": ""40724712"", ""text"": ""Transforming Palliative Care for Rural Patients with COPD Through Nurse-Led Models.."", ""source"": ""pubmed:40724712""}}, {""text"": ""[Optimizing a standardized management model for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary healthcare institutions].."", ""score"": 0.5786750316619873, ""source"": ""MED:40660973"", ""meta"": {""id"": ""40660973"", ""text"": ""[Optimizing a standardized management model for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary healthcare institutions].."", ""source"": ""MED:40660973""}}]"

Although the prevalence of SO is on the rise, there is a notable paucity of research examining the impact of SO on weight loss efficacy following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). To investigate the impact of SO on weight loss outcomes and recurrent weight gain following LSG. We retrospectively gathered clinical data of 104 patients with obesity who underwent LSG in our hospital between January 2020 and September 2023. The ratio of fat mass to lean mass ≥0.8 was calculated for SO. Among them, the SO group (n=34) and the non-sarcopenic obesity (NSO) group (n=70), and the effect of SO on weight loss outcomes and recurrent weight gain were comparatively analyzed. Within one year after LSG, SO patients had an apparently higher average body mass index, excess body mass index, and lower average percentage of excess weight loss than NSO patients (P<0.05). Furthermore, NSO patients had a statistically striking optimal weight loss rate more than SO patients in the first year after surgery (58.6% vs 35.3%, P=0.026). Within two years after LSG, SO patients had a lower occurrence rate of recurrent weight gain than NSO patients. Nonetheless, this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.212). Additionally, diabetes was an independent risk factor for recurrent weight gain postoperatively in patients with obesity when both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted (P<0.05). SO adversely affects short-term weight loss outcomes after LSG.
